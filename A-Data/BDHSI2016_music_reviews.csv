Don't Panic	All Time Low	Pop/Rock	2012-10-09 00:00:00	Kerrang!	74.0	"While For Baltimore proves they can still write a grade A banger when they put their mind to it, too many songs are destined to have ""must try harder"" stamped on their report card. [13 Oct 2012, p.52]"
Fear and Saturday Night	Ryan Bingham	Country	2015-01-20 00:00:00	Uncut	70.0	"There's nothing fake about the purgatorial narrative of songs such as ""Nobody Knows My Trouble"" and ""My Diamond Is Too Rough."" [Feb 2015, p.74]"
The Way I'm Livin'	Lee Ann Womack	Country	2014-09-23 00:00:00	Q Magazine	84.0	All life's disastrous lows are here on a career-high album. [Nov 2014, p.121]
Doris	Earl Sweatshirt	Rap	2013-08-20 00:00:00	Pitchfork	82.0	With Doris, Odd Future’s Odysseus is finally back and chasing the ghosts out of his head.
Giraffe	Echoboy	Rock	2003-02-25 00:00:00	AllMusic	71.0	"Though Giraffe is definitely Echoboy's most immediate and cohesive work, it's not perfect: the album takes a misguided turn toward the dark and overwrought on songs like ""Lately Lonely"" and ""Wasted Spaces,"" both of which recall the harsher moments of Primal Scream's Evil Heat."
Weathervanes	Freelance Whales	Indie	2010-04-13 00:00:00	Q Magazine	68.0	"Fans of Owl City and The Postal Service will relish such good clean fun, quite literally when Dadone warbles, ""Don't let the bathwater get too high"" on Starring. [Oct 2010, p.107]"
Build a Rocket Boys!	Elbow	Pop/Rock	2011-04-12 00:00:00	Delusions of Adequacy	82.0	Whereas previous Elbow records set a mood, Build A Rocket Boys! may require a certain mood, and a few spins, before the lofty expectations are shed and you're left delighting in its radiance.
Ambivalence Avenue	Bibio	Indie	2009-06-23 00:00:00	Q Magazine	78.0	"His remarkable Warp debut follows a series of effective ""folktronica"" albums on the US independent Mush. [Jul 2009, p.117]"
Wavvves	Wavves	Indie	2009-03-17 00:00:00	PopMatters	68.0	There’s an energy coursing through this, and records like this, that is undeniable....But there’s also your standard fare. Several of the songs sound the same. There are a couple of atmospheric tunes that add no atmosphere.
Peachtree Road	Elton John	Rock	2004-11-09 00:00:00	MelD.	70.0	Classic. Songs filled with soul. Lyrics refreshing. My personal favorite Weight of the World.

Heritage	College	Electronic	2013-09-17 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	63.0	It’s by no means perfect and it does feel slightly one-paced, but the layers of Heritage are undoubtedly worth unravelling.
White Chalk	PJ Harvey	Rock	2007-09-25 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	80.0	"Put in context, White Chalk serves her purposes, much as Bruce Springsteen’s ""Nebraska"" served his. On initial listen, the album is not a step forward, nor is it a step back, but rather a lateral move intended to leave breathing room for her next attack."
Tyrannosaurus Hives	The Hives	Rock	2004-07-20 00:00:00	Playlouder	78.0	Although pretty catchy, this album is a tad too monotonous.
JackInABox	Turin Brakes	Indie	2005-06-07 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	62.0	Talk about a fall from grace. [4 Jun 2005, p.58]
Liquid Love	Shy Child	Indie	2010-03-15 00:00:00	The Guardian	70.0	It's unusual to find a band equally at home with electronic funk and soft rock who can produce an album that will delight fans of either.
The  Truth About Love	P!nk	Pop	2012-09-18 00:00:00	The Guardian	77.0	It's just a shame she gave album space to Mariah-slick motivational ballads such as The Great Escape, which detract from an otherwise fierce record.
The Monitor	Titus Andronicus	Indie	2010-03-09 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	82.0	The fundamental difference between The Monitor and the group's debut, The Airing of Grievances, and the reason why the former shines less bright than the latter, is in the attitude.
Ones and Sixes	Low	Pop/Rock	2015-09-11 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	78.0	It just needs to be a passionate, cathartic, connective emotional experience. For the most part, Ones and Sixes fits that bill.
In Search Of... [First Version]	N.E.R.D. [The Neptunes]	Rap	2001-08-06 00:00:00	Q Magazine	92.0	They retained their best ideas for themselves though, since their debut album is striking escape from mere genre. [Review of UK version]
Tarot Sport	Fuck Buttons	Rock	2009-10-20 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	84.0	For most of the songs amassed here, it still takes around 10 minutes to get the job done--threading those thick synthesizer blasts and all that skittering digital manna through a brick wall of guitar fuzz--but Fuck Buttons succeeds at turning its unpredictable epics into masterpieces of pacing and strange beauty.
July Flame	Laura Veirs	Indie	2010-01-12 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	81.0	Laura Veirs makes an excellent case for herself as one of the most under-recognised singer-songwriters working today and the album's summery soul lingers long after first listen.
Lux	Brian Eno	Electronic	2012-11-13 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	75.0	Sure, it's beautiful on its own, but without any visuals (that is unless you create your own), LUX meanders while the listener potentially zones in and out.
Live At The Olympia	R.E.M.	Rock	2009-10-27 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	74.0	Though it isn’t a concept album, Live At The Olympia does tell a story about the remarkable staying power of one of the best rock bands of the past 30 years.
Ten Thousand Fists	Disturbed	Rock	2005-09-20 00:00:00	Amazon.com	59.0	"The album isn't without its problems––come the halfway mark (""Sons of Plunder"") vocalist David Draiman and his mates lapse into the expected, with a series of songs that are good but rarely as remarkable as those found in Act I."
New Danger	Mos Def	Rap	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	59.0	The New Danger is as overextended as it is self-indulgent.
NYC	Kieran Hebden and Steve Reid	Indie	2008-11-18 00:00:00	The Wire	61.0	Hebden is clearly striving for dancefloor impact--but Reid's drumming is so untethered and, frankly, messy, that it sucks the explosions out of whatever bombs Hebden's trying to drop. [Dec 2008, p.60]
Hold On Now, Youngster	Los Campesinos!	Indie	2008-04-01 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	81.0	It might be one big, saccharine, catchy fuck-you to the industry and culture, but it's really just addictive songwriting reared on Britpop pioneers who didn't prioritize reputation over substance.
Tiny Rebels [EP]	Cairo Gang	Pop/Rock	2013-07-23 00:00:00	Uncut	64.0	The Cairo Gang's superb, weighty, meticulous album still manages to pack a mighty punch. [Sep 2013, p.85]
Wavering Radiant	Isis	Rock	2009-05-05 00:00:00	No Ripcord	79.0	As snobbish as that may sound, you have to lose yourself in Wavering Radiant to hear and feel the big picture.
Sound Mirrors	Coldcut	Electronic	2006-02-21 00:00:00	Playlouder	73.0	Any number of tracks here could easily catapult them back into the consciousness of so much more than the cognoscenti.
Girls in Peacetime Want to Dance	Belle & Sebastian	Pop/Rock	2015-01-20 00:00:00	The Telegraph (UK)	76.0	Atlanta-based producer Ben H Allen (who has worked with Animal Collective and CeeLo Green) has beefed up their sound, although a taste for clean sonic lines and cheesy keyboards retains a power to grate.
45:33	LCD Soundsystem	Electronic	2007-11-13 00:00:00	The Guardian	86.0	You can hear an early, instrumental version of 'Someone Great' here, and it's pretty melody, twinkling xylophones and pulsing synths are mesmerising enough to take your mind off the pain of physical exertion.
Swings Both Ways	Robbie Williams	Pop	2013-11-18 00:00:00	alicegoldman	58.0	"Most of songs are written by the artist himself and, as usual, very personal. Playing with haters, fatherhood and other situations this soundsMost of songs are written by the artist himself and, as usual, very personal. Playing with haters, fatherhood and other situations this sounds very fun and consistent, some songs like ""Shine My Shoes"" are just brilliant.

Kala	M.I.A.	Rap	2007-08-21 00:00:00	Dot Music	87.0	Three loud cheers for her scattershot creativity, please.
Fork In The Road	Neil Young	Rock	2009-04-07 00:00:00	AllMusic	61.0	Fork in the Road is charmingly clunky, a side effect of its quick creation and Young's hard-headedness. Neil might be writing records as quickly as a blogger these days but musically he's stuck in the past, never letting go of his chunky Les Paul and candied folk harmonies.
Two Against Nature	Steely Dan	Rock	2000-02-29 00:00:00	Village Voice	77.0	The music turns Aja's fusion-pop mode jumpier and snappier, sourer and trickier and less soothing--postfunk, whether anyone will admit it or not.
The Duke & the King	The Duke & the King	Country	2011-08-16 00:00:00	AllMusic	80.0	Felice is bedeviled by an unspecified sadness and longing, and that only adds to the resonance of well-constructed songs that will appeal to triple-A radio in the U.S., now that his band finally has gotten a purchase on its homeground.
Girls Can Tell	Spoon	Indie	2001-02-20 00:00:00	Spin Cycle	85.0	Spoon is the best British band to come out of Austin, Texas.

Being the old goth that I was I instantly fell in love with the artwork on the album,  and read a couple of critic notes on the front of it, so I bought it, a good way to waste money to buy an album without hearing or knowing about a band.  But I was pleasantly surprised at how good this album is.  Nice subtle melodies, romantic lyrics and some pretty fine guitar and drums.  It's a new band I have discovered, and I am glad I did!  One of my favorites this month as far as current releases go.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;

They have tried to innovate by moving to a more song oriented structure, but most of these songs simply do not work. The album lacks any kind of coherence, and a couple of good tracks fail to save the album from mediocrity.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Creatures	Elf Power	Indie	2002-05-07 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	77.0	The record is as tuneful and spirited and bordering-on-goofy as anything in the Elf Power catalog.
Black Noise	Pantha du Prince	Electronic	2010-02-09 00:00:00	No Ripcord	83.0	"Where [""The Bliss""] bubbled and spat like hot fat, its meticulous construction overflowing with polyrhythms, Black Noise seems disjointed and overlong even though it runs for roughly the same duration."
Everywhere At Once	Lyrics Born	Rap	2008-04-22 00:00:00	Under The Radar	66.0	Lyrics Born is capable of a game-changing album, but Everywhere At Once seems like a step backwards. [Spring 2008, p.85]
Geronimo!	Piney Gir	Pop/Rock	2011-10-24 00:00:00	Q Magazine	67.0	A charming little diversion from the cares of the modern world. [Dec. 2011 p. 135]
King Night	Salem	Electronic	2010-09-28 00:00:00	Clash Music	72.0	Rave horns echo like WW2 sirens being played on a fucked-up ghetto blaster while the cast of House Of 1000 Corpses do their best Gucci Mane impressions--an interesting, if perhaps slightly contrived, oddity.
The Miner's Hymns	Johann Johannsson	Electronic	2011-05-24 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	84.0	Best listened to in silence on a home stereo with cinematic projection; this is a remarkable achievement from Johannsson, and a welcome change from the string-drenched sound that has become ubiquitous in modern film scores.
April	Sun Kil Moon	Indie	2008-04-01 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	80.0	April, his third full-length under the Sun Kil Moon moniker, and the first made up of new songs since 2003, easily bears the weight of expectations, proving once again that he really does transcend any slowcore or singer-songwriter tags that have been tossed his way.
The Great Misdirect	Between the Buried and Me	Rock	2009-10-26 00:00:00	BillC	64.0	Don&#039;t ever listen to the critics when it comes to music.

Femme Fatale	Britney Spears	Pop	2011-03-29 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	67.0	Less adventurous is her sex-on-the-dance-floor lyrical fixation, so it's those playful touches that set Femme Fatale apart from most cornball dance pop on the radio these days.
From A Basement On The Hill	Elliott Smith	Indie	2004-10-19 00:00:00	Billboard	88.0	Smith bundles subtlety and ferocity to create one of his heart-aching best.
Cool Choices	S	Pop/Rock	2014-09-23 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	68.0	The emotions channeled here are wrenching, but they’re also honest, and this album’s victories feel earned.
Shady XV	Eminem	Rap	2014-11-24 00:00:00	New York Daily News (Jim Faber)	61.0	Only a few tracks, like “Guts Over Fear” (with guest vocals from Sia) bore inside the rapper to show his vulnerable side. But the snarl of the rest finds him at a peak of writerly dexterity and rhyming velocity.
The Devil, You + Me	The Notwist	Rock	2008-06-17 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	74.0	There’s no doubting it’s a very good album. The band’s best? Probably not. A successful return from a hiatus overlong? Certainly.
Blood Red Shoes	Blood Red Shoes	Pop/Rock	2014-03-03 00:00:00	Mojo	64.0	It's breathless stuff, but can feel homogenous after a while. [Apr 2014, p.98]
Dream River	Bill Callahan	Pop/Rock	2013-09-17 00:00:00	The Independent on Sunday (UK)	84.0	Though his appeal remains frustratingly specialist, with each release it becomes clearer that Callahan is the natural successor to Leonard Cohen.
Stephen Malkmus	Stephen Malkmus	Indie	2001-02-13 00:00:00	AllMusic	82.0	No, it's not quite the same as another Pavement album, but its literate, funny eclecticism is almost as irresistible.
Ray Guns Are Not Just The Future	The Bird And The Bee	Indie	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Urb	71.0	Ray Guns Are Not Just the Future is a pop gem for the young at heart and proof that the duo possesses the serious musical talent needed bring their whimsical musical visions to life.
Punish, Honey	Vessel	Electronic	2014-09-16 00:00:00	Pitchfork	81.0	Unquestionably, Gainsborough's sonic ingenuity continues to be his greatest asset; his growth as an artist hinges on accepting that others can't always enjoy his noise as much as he does.
Prisoner of Conscious	Talib Kweli	Rap	2013-05-07 00:00:00	Q Magazine	65.0	He seems content to occupy the same '90s underground niche he's always done. [Jun 2013, p.90]
The Ganzfeld [EP]	Matmos	Pop/Rock	2012-10-16 00:00:00	AllMusic	61.0	The three songs for The Ganzfeld EP manage to go all over the map in under half-an-hour.
Angels & Devils	The Bug	Electronic	2014-08-26 00:00:00	The Quietus	83.0	An album that's otherwise remarkably deft at uniting the many aspects of Kevin Martin's musical output to date.
Heat Lightning Rumbles in the Distance	Patterson Hood	Country	2012-09-11 00:00:00	Mojo	77.0	Scratchily downbeat, this is a true artist's vision in that Hood can remove himself from the pain without stinting on the honesty. [Oct 2012, p.82]
I Look To You	Whitney Houston	Pop	2009-08-31 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	66.0	For the most part, I Look to You manages to sound completely contemporary without the use of guest rappers, dumbed-down lyrics, or slang.
Hold Time	M. Ward	Rock	2009-02-17 00:00:00	Dot Music	79.0	While its thoughtfulness prevents it from getting carried away with itself--he's not exactly doing the can-can here--there is a definite sense of optimism and personal brightness radiating from all four corners of this record. It will be a difficult one to top.
Seasons on Earth	Meg Baird	Folk	2011-09-20 00:00:00	Magnet	73.0	This compelling album is dominated by a spirit of grace and hope. [#81, p. 53]
The Con	Tegan and Sara	Indie	2007-07-24 00:00:00	Amazon.com	80.0	The Con skillfully packs its instant hooks in so tight, virtually every line becomes the one you want to sing along to--and the twins' lyrics aren't your typical pop pabulum.
Gist Is	Adult Jazz	Pop/Rock	2014-08-05 00:00:00	No Ripcord	77.0	This album is a grower.
Overexposed	Maroon 5	Pop	2012-06-26 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	54.0	On much of the album, which never quite finds a balance between rock grit and dance-pop glitz, Maroon 5 barely sound like a band at all.
Want Two	Rufus Wainwright	Rock	2004-11-16 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	78.0	Certainly Want Two is the weaker and less tuneful of the siblings, strings, horns, pipes and choirs distracting attention from the occasionally dirgey and indulgent (but still grandiose) melodies.
Marry Me	St. Vincent	Indie	2007-07-10 00:00:00	PopMatters	78.0	For those who have not heard St. Vincent, the best approach is listening to her album because it’s so damn good.
The Magic Magicians	The Magic Magicians	Indie	2003-06-17 00:00:00	Alternative Press	67.0	Powerful drum beats user along the sometimes-Jack White, sometimes-Mick Jones vocals, while the guitar croons expressively throughout these low-key, lo-fi songs. [Aug 2003, p.96]
The Instigator	Rhett Miller	Rock	2002-09-24 00:00:00	Blender	70.0	Miller ups the melodic ante, staking his claim to becoming his generation's answer to Nick Lowe or Marshall Crenshaw. [#10, p.123]
Off With Their Heads	Kaiser Chiefs	Rock	2008-10-28 00:00:00	The Guardian	70.0	Off With Their Heads is more football chant schmindie, with only the briefest of diversions up Psycho Rock Avenue.
Descended Like Vultures	Rogue Wave	Indie	2005-10-25 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	72.0	If not as easy to embrace as its predecessor, the album compensates with a great deal more ambition in its scope.
My Heart Has A Wish That You Would Not Go	Aereogramme	Indie	2007-02-06 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	70.0	Here, Aereogramme have created something more than deserving of all the praise lavished upon it.
Mermaid Avenue Vol. II	Billy Bragg & Wilco	Rock	2000-05-30 00:00:00	Q Magazine	82.0	Vol. 2 proves the equivalent of its parent release.
Sam's Town	The Killers	Rock	2006-10-03 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	64.0	Taken as a body of work it is certainly more consistent than Hot Fuss.
Creatures of an Hour	Still Corners	Pop/Rock	2011-10-11 00:00:00	Under The Radar	78.0	In this impressive debut, Still Corners has crafted an appropriate album for the autumn season.
When The Sun Goes Down	Kenny Chesney	Country	2004-02-03 00:00:00	danettef	67.0	I feel a connection! but only I can be the one to share that, in person..reality is here but spirituality comes from from understanding!
Cannibal Sea	The Essex Green	Indie	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Under The Radar	78.0	Seems just a bit empty. [#13, p.91]
All I Intended To Be	Emmylou Harris	Country	2008-06-10 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	78.0	All I Intended to Be, the country legend's first album in five years features terrific, hushed versions of Patty Griffin's ''Moon Song,'' Tracy Chapman's ''All That You Have Is Your Soul,'' and Billy Joe Shaver's ''Old Five and Dimers Like Me.'' But Harris can also turn it on in the songwriting department, as she proves in ''Gold.''
The Music	The Music	Indie	2003-02-25 00:00:00	Spin	58.0	What's most British about the Music is their tendency to try way too hard. [Apr 2003, p.108]
Neon Bible	Arcade Fire	Indie	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	87.0	Some Funeral devotees may be disappointed by the more straightforward approach on Neon Bible, but their numbers will likely be easily replaced.
Blak and Blu	Gary Clark, Jr.	Pop/Rock	2012-10-22 00:00:00	Boston Globe	74.0	Blak and Blu pays off; it's not a perfect album, but it is bold and exciting.
Illmatic XX [20th Anniversary Edition]	Nas	Rap	2014-04-15 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	89.0	As perfect as Illmatic is, there are plenty of crevices that can be explored and different musical avenues to test Nas’s verses/scriptures.
Goon	Tobias Jesso Jr.	Pop/Rock	2015-03-17 00:00:00	The 405	81.0	His debut album experiments with intense sincerity and captivating subtleties in the lyrics and melodies respectively.
Power in the Blood	Buffy Sainte-Marie	Folk	2015-05-12 00:00:00	Spin	78.0	Power in the Blood is the work of an elder working against genre, knowing history, and moving forward into aesthetically unknown territory. For a septuagenarian, the optimism of it is heartening.
Pink City	Jennifer Castle	Pop/Rock	2014-09-02 00:00:00	Blurt Magazine	85.0	Pink City is her prettiest, most cohesive work yet. It’s well-constructed enough to showcase the weirdness that crops up in her songs without making her seem like a novelty act.
Distortion	Magnetic Fields	Indie	2008-01-15 00:00:00	Boston Globe	79.0	Distortion isn't an easy listen, with its strict, difficult palette. But it's an endlessly fascinating and provocative one.
Food	Kelis	R&B;	2014-04-22 00:00:00	AllMusic	77.0	While it remains almost impossible to dissociate Kelis and early collaborators the Neptunes, it's more difficult imagining a better creative alliance--at this point in her career, at least--than the one that shines here.
Mutilator Defeated at Last	Thee Oh Sees	Pop/Rock	2015-05-26 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	82.0	While not front-to-back pummeling, Mutilator Defeated At Last is fast and hard for much of its 33 minutes.
Nebula Dance	Ital Tek	Electronic	2012-10-30 00:00:00	Resident Advisor	74.0	His third album is easily the tightest record yet. Jumping from sound to sound, Ital Tek has covered a startling amount of ground in a short time.

12 Memories	Travis	Rock	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Dot Music	64.0	A bitterly disappointing, lacklustre album that is sadly short of distinct memories of any kind.

I would go as far as to say there are more standout tracks on this album over digitalism. The only flaw of this record is that the last half is a mess. In particular its not worth listening to anything past track 7. Still a great debut that like daft punk and digitalism, they choose to use vintage gear over laptops, which in this day and age is more unique and creative than any ambient or idm out this year.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Tres Cabrones	Melvins	Pop/Rock	2013-11-05 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	69.0	The initial feeling that this album is destined to be one of their many jokey, disposable ventures dissipates slightly as Osborne’s near-peerless ability with a brain-alteringly great riff takes hold.
The World is Yours	Ian Brown	Rock	2007-09-24 00:00:00	Uncut	58.0	More memorable for famous guests than fine tunes, The World Is Yours does not diminish Brown’s reputation, but it lacks the exotic, adventurous reach of his best work.
Herein Wild	Frankie Rose	Pop/Rock	2013-09-24 00:00:00	The New York Times	72.0	Ms. Rose’s pop confections aren’t simple escapes.

The production valueBig Spitta fan here, but his remarkable consistency with the amount of work might hurt his case a tad with this  album. The production value is on point as always, and gives the fans exactly what they would have expected in terms of a sound and a lyrical/content/vibe perspective. However because of this, there are no tracks that jump out at me on this project despite the overall great vibe and cohesive sound to it. Good project, but I've heard better from Mr. Andretti, and thus I have come to expect as such.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;

The Stoop	Little Jackie	R&B;	2008-07-08 00:00:00	Spin	72.0	Only in the fire-hydrant-ready title cut, where an around-the-way girl reminisces about bodegas in Bed-Stuy, does Coppola seem like more than a confessional folkie playing funky dress-up.

G I R L	Pharrell Williams	Pop/Rock	2014-03-03 00:00:00	The Line of Best Fit	67.0	If a long playing ode to the wonder of women was the driving concept behind G I R L, then of course, Williams has failed. If however, you want to hear an artist at the height of his popularity who’s all up in this place for a good time, then grab a hand and raise a cup (if you must), this G I R L will keep you entertained throughout.
Native To	Is Tropical	Electronic	2011-06-13 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	57.0	Though Gary Barber's half-spoken, oh-so-London urchin coo brings a little quirk to proceedings, for the most part Native To is a pleasant but not memorable listen.

Wonderful, Glorious	Eels	Pop/Rock	2013-02-05 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	76.0	From the moment ‘Bombs Away’ hoves menacingly into view, it’s clear this is Eels at their most visceral.
For The Recently Found Innocent	White Fence	Pop/Rock	2014-07-22 00:00:00	The 405	74.0	It pains me to overly criticise an album that may be quite enjoyable if you were born in the '70s and have only ever looked forward for your music, but there's no avoiding this particular White Fence could have done with a second coat to better hide what's beneath.

The Grind Date	De La Soul	Rap	2004-10-05 00:00:00	AllMusic	80.0	Without a concept to tout, The Grind Date doesn't gel like AOI: Bionix, but it does show De La Soul keeping everything together more than 15 years after their debut.
Beautifulgarbage	Garbage	Rock	2001-10-02 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	69.0	If you didn't know better, you'd think you were listening to a compilation, not a band album.
Becoming A Jackal	Villagers	Indie	2010-06-08 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	78.0	If you set aside some uninspired, cryptic-as-poetic moody fantasy lyrics (and a few forgettable songs truly as slight as whispers), Becoming a Jackal reveals a hidden stash of imminently memorable melodies.
SBTRKT	SBTRKT	Electronic	2011-06-28 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	76.0	What these tracks are, though, are lovingly programmed, laser-dappled, preening--thanks to Sampha's buttery soul voice--and glossy reduxes of late-'90s two-step and twitchy post-house that should be filed next to James Blake and Jamie Woon.
Tentacles	Crystal Antlers	Indie	2009-04-07 00:00:00	No Ripcord	71.0	The Crystal Antlers’ debut is a flesh-fattened cloud prowler emanating a strange, jilted tenderness, a record whose devastating expressive weight is amplified, not obscured, by its deranged, frayed-edge make-up.
Party Intellectuals	Marc Ribot's Ceramic Dog	Rock	2008-06-24 00:00:00	The Boston Phoenix	80.0	Humor, melody, and weirdness rule, and that makes Ceramic Dog lighter than both Ribot’s Los Cubanos Postizos Afro-Cuban band and his aggro-noise outfit Shrek.

Cut the World [Live]	Antony and the Johnsons	Pop/Rock	2012-08-07 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	82.0	The 12 tracks place Antony in an exposed and elegant state: away from the studio, under the lights of a concert hall, and engulfed in harmonies. On that stage, he soars.
Wu-Massacre	Meth-Ghost-Rae	Rap	2010-03-30 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	73.0	Cuban Linx 2 was a glorious mess, but Wu-Massacre throws so many punches I feel at times like I’m listening to a promotional album sampler for some amazing full-length to be released later in the year.

Success	KEN mode	Pop/Rock	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	65.0	At its best, KEN Mode grabs handfuls of patches from heavy, pissed off bands and sews them together into a single misanthropic flag. By honing in on a smaller set of influences on Success, the trio are forced to blow up their image to a much larger scale.

Home	Dierks Bentley	Country	2012-02-07 00:00:00	PopMatters	70.0	Whether it represents Bentley releasing his inner stalker or not, there is a deep undercurrent of human longing on the album, on the fun and serious songs alike.

The Drop	Pinkunoizu	Pop/Rock	2013-08-05 00:00:00	Q Magazine	76.0	There's little outright originality, but they're melodically strong and the male-female vocal interchange between Andreas Pallisgaard and drummer Jaleh Negari is captivating. [Sep 2013, p.107]

The title track is a nice, psychedelic affair and 'Bleeding Heart' keeps Jimi bluesy, these along with Hear My Train A' Comin' are the best tracks on the album. But, the album is made worse by instrumentals that are nothing special. The album seems to forgot, Jimi's most underrated aspect, his superb voice and it serves to its detriment.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Disconnection Notice	Goldfinger	Rock	2005-02-15 00:00:00	PopMatters	52.0	Odd sonic and thematic tonal choices plague the album.
The Mountain	Heartless Bastards	Indie	2009-02-03 00:00:00	Pitchfork	75.0	With The Mountain, Heartless Bastards have shown that they have the tools and the talent to take at least tentative steps forward into a more ambitious and diverse sound. But it's surprising that they sound so introspective here when they could, and occasionally do, sound world-beating.
What It Means to Be Left-Handed	Mice Parade	Electronic	2010-09-14 00:00:00	Delusions of Adequacy	77.0	What it Means to Be Left-Handed is just that: a diverse assortment of refreshing new music from a band that has already developed and progressed their chops. It's a joyful occasion and for Mice Parade; a loud celebration down the street, rodents and all.
The Beekeeper	Tori Amos	Rock	2005-02-22 00:00:00	The New York Times	65.0	Her most down-to-earth album in years, because Ms. Amos has decided she doesn't have to pack every impulse into every song. Sometimes, now, a simple melody and a steady groove are enough. [21 Feb 2005]
The Stand Ins	Okkervil River	Indie	2008-09-09 00:00:00	The New York Times	78.0	Self-conscious as the lyrics are, the music is uninhibited: lurching into motion like a bar band, picking up speed, piling up instruments and letting them fall away.
Still Not Getting Any	Simple Plan	Rock	2004-10-26 00:00:00	Spin	66.0	[Simple Plan is] a band as spiritually distant from Dookie as John Mayaer is from Blind Willie McTell. [Dec 2004, p.124]

Pull My Hair Back	Jessy Lanza	Electronic	2013-09-17 00:00:00	The Wire	79.0	The R&B; tropes are part of a reassuring past, and the half-there vocals don't add enigma so much as leave the music unchallenged and stick in its old ways. [Oct 2013, p.47]

Endless Wire	The Who	Rock	2006-10-31 00:00:00	Village Voice	64.0	Townshend's faith in rock 'n' roll as an appropriate vehicle for his biggest ideas is admirable, but Endless Wire does little to justify his devotion.
Peace Is the Mission	Major Lazer	Electronic	2015-06-01 00:00:00	Magnet	68.0	The best cuts here happen to be those hewing closer to Major Lazer's wake-and-bake dancehall origins. [No. 121, p.57]

Walking Field	Peals	Pop/Rock	2013-05-14 00:00:00	Mojo	75.0	Buzzing with delicate analogue warmth, the gamelan rhythms, toy-piano chimes and warped guitar loops or Walking Field are lullingly hypnotic and eerily deja entendu. [Jul 2013, p.87]
Doin' It Again	Skepta	Electronic	2011-01-31 00:00:00	The Guardian	56.0	With a distinctive, authentic voice and a sharp sense of humour, Doin' It Again may not make No 1, but it ought to allow Skepta to continue palling around with P Diddy in the knowledge he's still keeping it real.
Diver	Lemonade	Pop/Rock	2012-05-29 00:00:00	Q Magazine	64.0	Diver's appeal is immediate, its effect short and sharp. [Sep 2012, p.104]

Walk the River	Guillemots	Alternative/Indie Rock	2011-04-18 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	68.0	With two songs playing out at over nine minutes long, one feels that a decent edit would change things from somnambulant to plain dreamy.

Bad Magic	Motörhead	Pop/Rock	2015-08-28 00:00:00	Classic Rock Magazine	80.0	Occasionally, as on Fire Storm Hotel, with its shades of an 80s hair metal anthem, he sounds at once energised and enfeebled and you find yourself willing him to reach the velocity of yore. But most of the time, you could play these tracks to an alien and they would struggle to tell them apart from Motörhead’s 90s, or even 70s, work.
Our Shadows Will Remain	Joseph Arthur	Indie	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	82.0	Watch out for this guy’s next album, because I can guarantee it will contain a Top 40 hit. Go ahead and listen to him now so as to impress your friends later.

Shock Value II	Timbaland	Rock	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	50.0	Justin Timberlake and Drake both offer admirable turns, but are forced to operate with unenviably tepid production. The overall laziness of that facet is even more inexcusable coming from one of the most renowned producers of the last decade.
At Best Cuckold	Avi Buffalo	Pop/Rock	2014-09-09 00:00:00	The Guardian	73.0	Notwithstanding the distinctive high pitch of his voice, Avi’s music has evolved from the childlike lightness of his debut’s glorious highlight Truth Sets In--and perhaps that’s the crucial point: the truth has set in.
WIXIW	Liars	Pop/Rock	2012-06-05 00:00:00	Q Magazine	81.0	For a record that strives to sound disembodied, it has a powerful grip. [Jul 2012, p.105]

Saint Bartlett	Damien Jurado	Indie	2010-05-25 00:00:00	American Songwriter	77.0	The sound is quintessentially opiate--almost sleep-inducing--and upon writing that, it should be clarified as a compliment, kind of like falling asleep to NPR: It gives good information, but the undertones and lush notes can lull you to dreams.
The Minimal Wave Tapes, Vol. 2	Various Artists	Electronic	2012-02-28 00:00:00	PopMatters	73.0	The Minimal Wave Tapes Volume 2 loses a bit of the first volume's vitality. Furthermore, by suggesting that this music can be replicated in any era, the collection betrays its former thesis that there was something particularly special about the historical circumstances that lead to all this music coming into being.
This Time Around	Hanson	Rock	2000-05-09 00:00:00	Billboard	67.0	It all adds up to a collection that successfully sets Hanson apart from the current teen-pop phenomenon that it helped start -- at least from a creative perspective.

Television Man	Naomi Punk	Pop/Rock	2014-08-05 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	71.0	Sure, the songs' formulaic stop-and-spurt attack can wear on the listener's ears after a while--but this is an album well worth risking tinnitus for.
Monkeytown	Modeselektor	Electronic	2011-10-11 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	67.0	Modeselektor's willingness to collaborate and explore sounds while still sticking to their identifiable, fat, bass-heavy crunk techno style is worth applauding, and there's no reason to think that they won't continue to remain relevant.
Heritage	College	Electronic	2013-09-17 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	63.0	Fortunately Grellier includes enough moments of excitement to keep Heritage less of a soundtrack album and more a French disco LP stripped of vocals.
Como te Llama	Albert Hammond, Jr.	Indie	2008-07-08 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	64.0	On his second solo record, guitarist Albert Hammond Jr. hedges his bets with familiar guitar-pop exercises alongside tracks that find him stretching into uncharacteristic territory.

Actor	St. Vincent	Indie	2009-05-05 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	81.0	Mostly, as Actor demonstrates, St. Vincent has found her own voice--and it’s one you wouldn’t want reading your kids any bedtime stories.
Animositisomina	Ministry	Rock	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Amazon.com	67.0	In a world gone mad, it's nice to know that some things--like Ministry's ability to tear up the floorboards with crushing efficiency--never change.
The Rose Has Teeth In The Mouth Of A Beast	Matmos	Electronic	2006-05-09 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	81.0	Matmos have created a digital manifestation of their own personality, one that would be done more justice through psychoanalysis than musical description.

The Lucky Ones	Mudhoney	Rock	2008-05-20 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	77.0	Lucky Ones is the sound of a band that obviously knows not to fuck with a good thing.
Yours to Discover	Sebastien Grainger	Pop/Rock	2013-11-12 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	64.0	There are a few clunker lyrics--Grainger’s at his strongest when he’s singing about making love, not having sex--but overall it’s a worthy record from an artist who refuses to make the same one twice.

Jump Leads	Fila Brazillia	Electronic	2002-02-26 00:00:00	PopMatters	73.0	"There's nothing on Jump Leads that makes me want to dance, or even roll a joint and lie on the floor, which was the main attraction of much of Fila Brazilia's prior output. Instead it all just makes me want to rest my chin on my hand and mutter, ""Hmm. Interesting."""

Dreams in the Rat House	Shannon and the Clams	Pop/Rock	2013-05-21 00:00:00	Pitchfork	74.0	Dreams in the Rat House combines elements of their debut, I Wanna Go Home (particularly the off-the-cuff hijinks and threadbare fidelity), with the songwriting focus of their great second effort, Sleep Talk.
Yeezus	Kanye West	Rap	2013-06-18 00:00:00	PopMatters	84.0	As a sonic experience, Yeezus isn’t as dangerous as it likes to think it is, but it’s certainly the epic banger Kanye’s worried he didn’t have in him since he first ran to Timbaland to help beef up his drum sounds on Graduation.

Kittenz And Thee Glitz	Felix Da Housecat	Dance	2002-01-22 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	78.0	Kittenz features a few too many barely sketched ideas, but its rough-hewn surface ultimately tightens the psychic squeeze.
The Visitor	Matias Aguayo	Electronic	2013-06-25 00:00:00	AllMusic	76.0	Listeners attached to Aguayo's comparatively spindly early-2000s work will hear much of this as cracked chaos, but the level of carefree delight brimming throughout has to be, at the very least, admired.
The Best Day	Thurston Moore	Pop/Rock	2014-10-21 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	75.0	As is typical with Moore, the vocal melodies on The Best Day are mostly afterthoughts that usually just blithely follow the guitar parts. Fortunately, this weakness is minimized by the fact that most of the riffs, rendered via a pristinely engineered dual-guitar attack, are excellent.
In Colour	Jamie xx	Electronic	2015-06-02 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	87.0	It opens with the aggressive, heady breakbeats of Gosh, and segues into songs heavy on his signature steel pans and clean productions that are sometimes dull in their tidy minimalism but ultimately contribute to a wistful atmosphere that's Smith's own.
Have One On Me	Joanna Newsom	Rock	2010-02-23 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	85.0	"It’s unlikely that you’ll often listen to it in one bout, but whether beguiled one day by its exotic petals and blooms or the next by the less showy trees in the background, Have One On Me is 
an Elysian record that you’ll return to again and again."
Threads	Now, Now	Pop/Rock	2012-03-06 00:00:00	DIY Magazine	77.0	An album which is deluged in melancholy of the sweetest kind, 'Threads' undoubtedly deserves your ears.
She's In Control	Chromeo	Indie	2004-02-17 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	72.0	The album is just disappointing: full of slick beats of undisguised artifice and lacking the one thing all good slow jams need – namely, great vocals.
Live @ The Fillmore	Lucinda Williams	Rock	2005-05-10 00:00:00	JohnB	73.0	This is without a doubt one of the great live cds to come out in some time. True Lucinda draws a lot of the music from World Without Tears,This is without a doubt one of the great live cds to come out in some time. True Lucinda draws a lot of the music from World Without Tears, it&#039;s only natural as that was the cd she was touring for when Live at the Filmore was recorded. Yes I would have liked her to have included more from Car Wheels, and her self titled album, but that being said, this is a really REALLY good CD. The music starts out with some of her slower, mellower material lulling the listener into a melancholic state of mind similar to that which one might expect from downing a bottle of cough syrup. But things quickly heat up by the end of the first disk, and really get smoking on disk 2, starting with Pineola right through to Real Live Bleeding Fingers etc. with the highlight of the whole cd sandwiched inbetween with an unbelievable version of Joy where Lucinda with her incredible vocals leaves no doubt in the listeners mind that she is going to find her Joy in Slidedale, West Memphis, or right there at the Filmore no matter the cost - the song is topped off with the incredible guitar work of Doug Pettibone. The intensity doesn&#039;t stop there either and keeps going right through the last notes of Words Fell. This is a very good cd and well worth the $14 I shelled out for it.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
First of a Living Breed	Homeboy Sandman	Rap	2012-09-18 00:00:00	BBC Music	77.0	The outcome is impressive, and throughout he remains true to himself and his esoteric style.
In Love With Oblivion	Crystal Stilts	Pop/Rock	2011-04-12 00:00:00	Filter	78.0	Little has changed for Crystal Stilts since 2008's Alight of Night, though maybe the guitars cheered up a bit. That's A-OK; they come through with such a sort of oblivious, Suicide-meets-Spiritualized feel, you'll be in love, too.

Fortress Around My Heart	Ida Maria	Rock	2009-04-14 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	74.0	Charmingly blunt and unpolished, Fortress instantly casts Maria as a distinctive talent among her established Scandinavian contemporaries.
The Last Kiss	Jadakiss	Rap	2009-04-07 00:00:00	Pitchfork	61.0	Jada's too talented to produce a completely worthless album, of course, and there are the usual one or two frustrating glimmers of the promise that keep getting him record deals.
Cadenza	Dutch Uncles	Pop/Rock	2011-04-25 00:00:00	The Guardian	67.0	Dutch Uncles sound like a band on the brink, and there's enough promise here to justify interest in what comes next.
Songs And Other Things	Tom Verlaine	Indie	2006-04-25 00:00:00	AllMusic	68.0	Typically cryptic and loaded with tasty guitar, Songs and Other Things is an excellent return for Tom Verlaine.
Bitter Honey	Eef Barzelay	Indie	2006-02-21 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	73.0	[The] most unexpectedly superb album so far this year.
Mirrored	Battles	Indie	2007-05-22 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	86.0	Battles unite process and expression, making playing that’s as quantized and mechanical as Kraftwerk sound as wild and urgent as Albert Ayler.
Comfort Eagle	Cake	Rock	2001-07-24 00:00:00	Blender	70.0	McCrea is still spinning wry, keenly observed stories, though the band has broadened its stylistic base some... [Aug/Sep 2001, p.121]
With Light and With Love	Woods	Pop/Rock	2014-04-15 00:00:00	Under The Radar	79.0	Next to the digitized, future-slicked sounds of other latter-day psych totems such as Lonerism or Merriweather Post Pavilion, it feels like a reverent, immersive ramble through the corridors of lysergic pop history.
Hidden	These New Puritans	Indie	2010-03-02 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	83.0	Despite the handful of standout tracks, what makes Hidden unique is the way it flows as a cohesive whole.

True Romance	Golden Silvers	Indie	2009-05-04 00:00:00	Dot Music	71.0	With their abilities to self-censure and decide at what's fundamentally good gone seriously awry, the results are more likely to induce a rolling of eyeballs and suppressed sniggers rather than gasps of admiration.
The Fall	Norah Jones	Rock	2009-11-17 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	73.0	The Fall is a concept album with a punchline, with most of the songs detailing the push and pull of a faltering relationship.

Indie Cindy	Pixies	Pop/Rock	2014-04-29 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	62.0	What makes Indie Cindy so egregious, so much worse than a simply bad album, is how much better it could have been.
Always Got Tonight	Chris Isaak	Rock	2002-02-12 00:00:00	Launch.com	70.0	It really isn't any different from any of the higher-charged rock albums in his repertoire.
Here Lies Love	David Byrne & Fatboy Slim	Rock	2010-04-06 00:00:00	Under The Radar	64.0	Pleasing yes, divine, occasionally--but Here Lies Love's strengths aren't enough to justify its bloated 22 tracks. [Spring 2010, p.69]
Ghetto Classics	Jaheim	R&B;	2006-02-14 00:00:00	audiosonique	67.0	"Jaheim's third offering is a breathy, almost softly-spoken-rather-than-sung album. When he does push his vocals, it rules every track, almostJaheim's third offering is a breathy, almost softly-spoken-rather-than-sung album. When he does push his vocals, it rules every track, almost to the point of dominating the mid-tempo production and 70's influenced hip-hop soul. What Jaheim does, which tends to divide opinion, is take his vocal quality and wrap them around lyrics that are far less subtle than his voice lets on. However, this quality of being abe to draw the listener in, show inner conflict in some way, gives him a unique niche, somewhere between thug and lady killer. Obviously this is highlighted on the song ""I Ain't Never"", as well as the single ""Everytime I Think About Her, featuring Jadakiss, who, seems equally at home with a languid rhyme which beguiles the subject matter of a conflicted man over a woman. The whole album, musically, just works, without too much effort, which makes it a very good listen.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"
Nocturama	Nick Cave And The Bad Seeds	Rock	2003-02-11 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	73.0	Mostly in the quieter mode of his past few efforts, Nocturama presents songs of faith and devotion in the face of doubt, again demonstrating his newfound gift for understatement and the smoky croon.
Fin	John Talabot	Electronic	2012-02-14 00:00:00	Mojo	80.0	His slow-burning music ... has serious cross-over potential. [Apr 2012, p.91]
The River & the Thread	Rosanne Cash	Country	2014-01-14 00:00:00	Blurt Magazine	87.0	As the title suggests, The River & The Thread manages to surge and sway all at the same time. Indeed, it doesn’t get much better than this.
Rio [Live]	Keith Jarrett	Jazz	2011-11-08 00:00:00	BBC Music	90.0	Jarrett has separated the ingredients into bite-sized chunks. With an audience as ecstatic as the one at the Teatro Municipal in Rio de Janeiro, where his new album was cut in April 2011, this works to the advantage of both. Jarrett builds a rapport with his public, and they can more easily adapt to the changes of mood and genre as his ideas develop.
The Golden Echo	Kimbra	Pop	2014-08-19 00:00:00	Magnet	70.0	She brings the art school to the dance floor in non-corny ways. [No. 112, p.57]
Holograms	Holograms	Pop/Rock	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Uncut	71.0	"Much of what is great about Stockholm's Holograms can be located in their debut single ""ABC City,"" a testament of the ""desolation"" of the grim suburbs of their home city delivered in a rowdy street-punk sneer. [Oct 2012, p.81]"
How Does It Feel	MS MR	Pop	2015-07-17 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	62.0	MS MR might lack some of the extrovert star quality of the acts Plapinger usually signs, but 'How Does It Feel' is an emotional ride that shows she has plenty of her own worth sharing.
Shocking Pinks	Shocking Pinks	Indie	2007-09-25 00:00:00	Under The Radar	76.0	This compilation boasts all the assets of an insular bedroom aesthetic, from quasi-confessioal lyrics to ample experimentation with styles and sounds. [Fall 2007, p.81]

Chase This Light	Jimmy Eat World	Rock	2007-10-16 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	66.0	Chase This Light is what emo should sound like: big emotions, sure, but also big hooks, big stakes. And big rewards. [19 Oct 2007, p.126]
You Can Feel Me	Har Mar Superstar	Indie	2002-11-05 00:00:00	Splendid	61.0	Yes, this is a funny record, but it's not a comedy record; Har Mar has an acrobatic voice that rivals pretty much any male in R&B; today, and he writes some genuinely catchy, sticky melodies that lots of other acts would kill for.
Fast Food	Nadine Shah	Pop/Rock	2015-05-05 00:00:00	The New York Times	78.0	Fast Food, is full of accusatory songs about love, often addressed to “you.” They spare no one.... Yet as bleak as things get, she refuses to retreat.
Ventriloquizzing	Fujiya & Miyagi	Electronic	2011-01-25 00:00:00	Spin	73.0	It's the sound of too-clever body-movers merely going through the motions.
Witch	Witch	Indie	2006-03-07 00:00:00	PopMatters	73.0	This is essentially one solid, irresistible 40-minute groove.
Walk the River	Guillemots	Alternative/Indie Rock	2011-04-18 00:00:00	AllMusic	68.0	An intimate and emotive affair which manages to pursue a slightly mellower direction while still retaining their trademark oddball sensibilities.
I Hate Music	Superchunk	Pop/Rock	2013-08-20 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	83.0	Falling down, getting up, and persevering through music is something Superchunk have done time and time again. On I Hate Music, they’ve bested even themselves.
A Hundred Miles Off	The Walkmen	Indie	2006-05-23 00:00:00	Lost At Sea	70.0	"Overall, A Hundred Miles Off is less intense than one may expect; there is no ""The Rat"" on this record."
Quicksand / Cradlesnakes	Califone	Indie	2003-03-18 00:00:00	Alternative Press	86.0	It's roots music that hums and rattles, hearing the dissonant sound of America singing and finding beauty in the collision of opposites. [Apr 2003, p.73]
Sun, Sun, Sun	The Elected	Indie	2006-01-24 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	63.0	The kind of album that might not make year-end lists, but just might make your year. [Feb/Mar 2006, p.109]
Song Yet To Be Sung	Perry Farrell	Rock	2001-07-17 00:00:00	Spin Cycle	60.0	The disappointing result is mostly a collection of thin-sounding electronic drum beats and trippy effects that, were it not for Farrell's vocal accompaniment, would be altogether forgettable.
Shaking the Habitual	The Knife	Electronic	2013-04-09 00:00:00	No Ripcord	85.0	Despite clear flaws though, enthusiastically raving about the album, even when taking into account that a third of it (including those aforementioned ten minutes of Fracking… ) is borderline irritating, feels entirely justified, rather than an exercise in willful perversion, thanks to the quality of everything else on offer.
Beauty & Crime	Suzanne Vega	Folk	2007-07-17 00:00:00	Hartford Courant	84.0	Beauty & Crime, an artful array distinguished by classy sonic design and lyrical charm.
Ys	Joanna Newsom	Indie	2006-11-14 00:00:00	Alternative Press	85.0	The beating heart of Newsom's tales, at turns whimsical and melancholic, enchant with a simple calculus: A woman, a harp and a story to tell. [Dec 2006, p.190]
Desperation	Oblivians	Pop/Rock	2013-05-28 00:00:00	American Songwriter	79.0	Everything is wrapped up in a breathless half hour and except for titles that aren’t quite as controversial as the immortal “I’m Not a Sicko, There’s a Plate in My Head,” this makes similar groups such as the veteran Fleshtones sound like Taylor Swift.
C'Mon Miracle	Mirah	Indie	2004-05-04 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	77.0	She creates an atmosphere of such intimate ease, you feel as if she's singing for you alone. [4 June 2004, p.80]
Snow Blindness Is Crystal Antz	Black Mold	Electronic	2009-08-11 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	56.0	If for no other reason than that VanGaalen is perfectly content to be an intuitive outsider to this “outsider” genre of music that he unplies, his Black Mold tastes fresh and new and, ultimately, life-giving to the likes of us.
Post-War	M. Ward	Indie	2006-08-22 00:00:00	Filter	81.0	An album confident enough in its substance to not force profound stylistic changes. [#21, p.100]
The Drift	Scott Walker	Rock	2006-05-23 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	85.0	No easy listening feat by any stretch of the imagination, Scott Walker's The Drift will provide critics and general music fans with talking points for the next 10 years. It is, simply, a work of staggering emotional sentiment and complexity that few will be able to match.
Hot Sauce Committee, Pt. 2	Beastie Boys	Rap	2011-05-03 00:00:00	The Wire	83.0	Hot Sauce Committee finds The Beastie Boys being The Beastie Boys with nothing that isn't exactly what on would expect from The Beastie Boys. [Jul 2011, p.44]
Supernova	Ray LaMontagne	Pop/Rock	2014-04-29 00:00:00	Uncut	78.0	Unexpectedly exhilarating. [Jun 2014, p.79]

National Treasures: The Complete Singles	Manic Street Preachers	Pop/Rock	2011-11-08 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	95.0	It's a glorious mess of contradictions, and what could say 'Manic Street Preachers' more than that?
Speech Therapy	Speech Debelle	Rap	2009-08-18 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	77.0	With lyrics so accomplished, entertaining and labyrinthine as these to be matched with well-measured, anti-bravado beats and textural sensitivity it’s difficult not to see a bright future for Speech Debelle.
Happyness	The Aluminum Group	Indie	2002-10-15 00:00:00	Uncut	77.0	Exquisite. [Feb 2003, p.80]
Machine [EP]	Yeah Yeah Yeahs	Indie	2002-11-05 00:00:00	Neumu.net	54.0	Let's face it, no one else today is making music as cool and original as that of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.
Loose In The Air	The Double	Indie	2005-09-13 00:00:00	sumac	78.0	This is an awesome album. But it must be listened to several times to really appreciate the nuance, particularly the drums.
Underwater Cinematographer	The Most Serene Republic	Indie	2005-07-12 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	68.0	Spirals downstream into dreary non-sequiturs faster than the glue addict who lives four blocks from me.
My Favourite Faded Fantasy	Damien Rice	Folk	2014-11-11 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	76.0	Where O was direct, raw and sober--cold and real in its confessional heartbreak--MFFF is aimlessly wistful and therefore more difficult to connect with.
Ready For Love	John Hammond	Rock	2003-02-11 00:00:00	Launch.com	76.0	From the sound of Hammond&#146;s latest it seems the swampy spunk of Wicked Grin has kept him fired up.
Drums Between the Bells	Brian Eno	Electronic	2011-07-05 00:00:00	Delusions of Adequacy	68.0	Drums Between the Bells is by no means an embarrassment, but don't look for it to be lumped into the upper echelon of Eno's output either, where triumphs like Discreet Music or Another Green World reside.
Does You Inspire You	Chairlift	Rock	2008-09-30 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	68.0	'Bruises,' the latest in a long line of bouncy pop ditties to ingratiate themselves into our collective pop consciousness via an iPod commercial, proves that the band is capable of being poignant without taking themselves too seriously, but much of Does You Inspire You, like the ode to pencils 'Evident Utensil,' veers a little too far into silly territory to elevate the album above a well-made and well-performed oddity.
Magnifique	Ratatat	Electronic	2015-07-17 00:00:00	Clash Music	70.0	It's dramatic, emotive, a little cheesy, but magnificently good fun.
Thing Of The Past	Vetiver	Rock	2008-05-13 00:00:00	AllMusic	74.0	Thing of the Past succeeds on three different fronts. Certainly, excellent song selection is one, inspired musicianship and arrangements another, but the actual sound of the recording is equally important in putting Thing of the Past across.
The Weight of Your Love	Editors	Pop/Rock	2013-07-09 00:00:00	Clash Music	55.0	The whole exercise seems so carefully crafted and desperately needy that any joy found within The Weight Of Your Love wears off the more you play it.
Rapor [EP]	Active Child	Pop/Rock	2013-10-22 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	70.0	Grossi's ability to deftly assimilate these more pop-oriented artists into his oeuvre is a testament to his growth since You Are All I See, resulting in his most confident release to date.
Era Extrana	Neon Indian	Pop/Rock	2011-09-13 00:00:00	Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM)	76.0	Era Extraña does not flow as smoothly as Psychic Chasms but the influences are in all the right places and it seems that Alan Palomo is wearing them proudly on his sleeve.
Peace Is the Mission	Major Lazer	Electronic	2015-06-01 00:00:00	Pitchfork	68.0	There is no doubt Peace Is the Mission will suffer some criticism from dancehall purists, those exhausted by EDM and people who hate Diplo (a hate that he has certainly worked overtime to earn), but their maturation is palpable across the album's nine tracks.
King Night	Salem	Electronic	2010-09-28 00:00:00	Pitchfork	72.0	King Night, accordingly, finds Salem pushing their sound far enough to create artistic distance from the rest of the pack.
#1	Fischerspooner	Dance	2003-02-25 00:00:00	PopMatters	70.0	It's shallow, pretentious, flamboyant, catchy, and just plain freaky at times, but unlike all the empty pop music you hear on mainstream radio today, this is one pop album that gets it right for once, and what a pure blast it is.
Aufheben	The Brian Jonestown Massacre	Pop/Rock	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Uncut	73.0	Ignore the arch titles and you'll find some lovely psych pastiches. [Jun 2012, p.69]
Young Adults Against Suicide	Ninja High School	Indie	2005-10-18 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	59.0	Young Adults Against Suicide is fun but two-dimensional.
King of Hearts	Camu Tao	Rap	2010-08-17 00:00:00	RapReviews.com	71.0	I fully respect his artistic and creative choices and his right to be his own man and not be defined by his years as a seminal underground rapper. I respect his choices, but I still pine for a Camu Tao we don't hear on this album and that we won't hear ever again. In the end I feel that his potential still went untapped.
Nootropics	Lower Dens	Pop/Rock	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Mojo	80.0	You're left with the impression that Lower Dens are both big sounding and very clever. [Jun 2012, p.85]
Wake Up The Nation	Paul Weller	Rock	2010-06-01 00:00:00	PopMatters	84.0	Wake Up the Nation, once again illustrates not only his perennial songwriting prowess, but also his incredible staying power amidst artists for whom influence is sporadic and brief at best.
Sunday Morning Record	The Band of Heathens	Country	2013-09-17 00:00:00	PopMatters	66.0	It’s a countrified album in the best sense of what was done in the mid-‘70s with records such as It’ll Shine When It Shines to a certain extent, just with more emphasis on the country end of the pop spectrum. Still, there are enough gems to be found here that, while not the sort of thing that might be readily apparent on anyone’s radio dial, hit the mark.
Jeff Bridges	Jeff Bridges	Country	2011-08-16 00:00:00	The Independent (UK)	65.0	It's all tastefully arranged.

Saturn's Pattern	Paul Weller	Pop/Rock	2015-05-19 00:00:00	The Independent (UK)	82.0	Weller’s magpie tendencies pay dividends.
One Day It Will Please Us To Remember Even This	New York Dolls	Rock	2006-07-25 00:00:00	Dot Music	75.0	It has fire in its belly and an admirable abandon and as a whirlwind tour of rock'n'roll decadence it makes, say, Jet look like the fey, foppish tourists they are.
Raditude	Weezer	Rock	2009-11-03 00:00:00	Pitchfork	57.0	Raditude doesn't have that stench of minimal calculation on it; if anything, it's as earnest as the famously confessional Pinkerton, just written by someone whose age doesn't match his POV.
The Way Out	The Books	Pop/Rock	2010-07-20 00:00:00	AllMusic	81.0	"The stated intention for The Way Out was for each track to be ""its own rabbit hole,"" and the album does indeed manage to survey an impressively disparate set of worlds and modes."
Reflektor	Arcade Fire	Pop/Rock	2013-10-29 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	80.0	"As a whole, there are throwaway tracks (""Porno"") and overstayed welcomes (ambiguous anthem ""We Exist""), Butler playing roulette with themes: the pains of indie rock (""Normal Person""), star-crossed Greek mythology (""Awful Sound [Oh Eurydice],"" ""It's Never Over [Oh Orpheus]""), and existential despair (""Afterlife"")."
The Other Side Of Daybreak	Beth Orton	Rock	2003-09-02 00:00:00	Urb	66.0	If you bought Daybreaker, stop! You're done. [Dec 2003, p.89]
Convivial	Luomo	Dance	2008-11-11 00:00:00	AllMusic	78.0	For its lack of rush-inducing highs and novel sounds, the album is immensely pleasurable, with fleet keyboard vamps and percussive effects that stab and flick ricocheting off pliant, bounding basslines.
All We Are	All We Are	Pop/Rock	2015-02-03 00:00:00	Q Magazine	68.0	This is music which feels as though it needs to be tethered down, lest it slip its moorings and float higher than the sun. [Mar 2015, p.115]
3121	Prince	Rock	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Q Magazine	69.0	There are songs here that are terrific.... But 3121 wouldn't be a Prince album if it wasn't also full of filler. [May 2006, p.119]
The Whole Love	Wilco	Pop/Rock	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Under The Radar	83.0	Some of the album's most arresting moments come as the dust settles.

Dagdrom	Nadja	Pop/Rock	2012-10-30 00:00:00	Pitchfork	72.0	The key to Dagdrøm's daunting mystique: You're never really sure if what you're hearing is the calm before the storm or the storm before the calm.
Nothing Hurts	Male Bonding	Indie	2010-05-11 00:00:00	PopMatters	77.0	But while you’d think the group’s hard-punching sound might be sloppy considering how it comes on so fast and furiously, it’s surprising how little wasted energy there is on Nothing Hurts, with most of any excess burned off of the album’s lean and mean half-hour running time.
Genuine Negro Jig	Carolina Chocolate Drops	Country	2010-02-16 00:00:00	PopMatters	78.0	Flemons, Robinson, and Giddens pull off the trick by sinking imperceptively into the rustic ether of the string rhythms. Though the music is not without personality, it is never overwhelmed by hints of the players’ modern origins.

Gravity the Seducer	Ladytron	Electronic	2011-09-13 00:00:00	Uncut	68.0	Rigidity is a hallmark of electropop, from Numan to Miss Kittin, but Ladytron's plodding rhythms and banal melodies straightjacket their songs. [Sep 2011, p.88]
Keys To The World	Richard Ashcroft	Rock	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Uncut	52.0	The qualities that once made The Verve the nation's top anthemists are recognisably intact on this new effort, from its stately pace to its burnished sense of grandeur. [Feb 2006, p.70]
Magnifique	Ratatat	Electronic	2015-07-17 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	70.0	Though the new Magnifique--the band’s first album in five years--doesn’t reinvent the Ratatat wheel, it revisits the status-quo thrill of those first two albums, while sprinkling in the hammock-swaying, breezy tropical vibe of both LP3 and LP4.

"The ""W"""	Wu-Tang Clan	Rap	2000-11-21 00:00:00	New York Magazine (Vulture)	80.0	The W is the sort of back-to-basics album that rock bands like the Who and the Rolling Stones used to make when they felt they were losing touch with their audience. It's capable but uninspiring -- Wu by Numbers.
Endless Now	Male Bonding	Pop/Rock	2011-08-30 00:00:00	PopMatters	70.0	Male Bonding proves it doesn't need to hide behind the gauze, because clearer fidelity actually highlights their strengths, putting their disparate parts in starker contrast to each other.
Echoes	The Rapture	Indie	2003-10-21 00:00:00	Launch.com	76.0	Luke Jenner's vocals may drive you insane, but he is to be ignored anyway. Echoes is all about perp-walking bass, funky white-boy cowbell, and enough brain-goring good guitar riffs to make Keith Richards collapse in amazement.

The last quarter is just ok at worse but it is still really good.  The singing with Zooey is great as always.  She has a very calming and diverse voice.  M.

I wish there were more louder songs and this had a little more quiet ones but even the quiet ones sound calming and meaningful.  I want to say this is my favorite She & Him album but I feel volume 2 beats this just by a little.

Sleep And Release	Aereogramme	Indie	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Splendid	78.0	Sure, they meld muscular riffs with smoky organ meditations, folky landscapes, pompous orchestration and the occasional IDM skitter, but not without losing the transcendent detail that makes each of these genres worth savoring and holding on to.
Doggumentary	Snoop Dogg	Rap	2011-03-29 00:00:00	RapReviews.com	58.0	"Snoop has been paying dues for two decades and change now, so he's earned the right to be a brand, an icon, a television star and most of all a rap legend. ""Doggumentary"" won't tarnish the polish on his O.G. status."
Elect The Dead	Serj Tankian	Rock	2007-10-23 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	68.0	His ambition is never entirely realized, and though his voice is versatile, his almost operatic style at times borders on annoying.

G.O.A.T. Featuring James T. Smith: The Greatest of All Time	LL Cool J	Rap	2000-08-22 00:00:00	Revolver	73.0	Backed by a bevy of sublime, aggravated tracks, G.O.A.T. is L.L.'s most aggressive, rhyme-centric effort since Radio. [#2, p.112]
Live at the Mark, Tom & Travis Show (The Enema Strikes Back)	Blink-182	Rock	2000-11-07 00:00:00	Sonicnet	56.0	This collection is a sugar-high set, adrenalized even more than Blink's souped-up studio albums by the waves of Cheap Trick Live at Budokan-like female screams pouring from the audience. And the playing offers plenty of evidence to quiet anyone who thinks these guys are just three-chord wonders.... But young audiences love Blink shows in part for the wiseacre, self-deprecating quips, and this album is full 'em -- and not just between songs, as there are (count 'em) 29 extra tracks of banter lasting over 10 minutes at the album's end.

Smother	Wild Beasts	Pop/Rock	2011-05-10 00:00:00	PopMatters	85.0	After you let it seep its way into your daily life, Smother reveals itself as the type of masterwork so fragile and unobtrusive as to leave itself vulnerable to being brushed away by those listeners without patience. Don't let yourself be among them.

Born to Die	Lana Del Rey	Pop/Rock	2012-01-31 00:00:00	AllMusic	62.0	"There is a chasm that separates ""Video Games"" from the other material and performances on the album, which aims for exactly the same target--sultry, sexy, wasted--but with none of the same lyrical grace, emotional power, or sympathetic productions."
Happiness Ltd.	Hot Hot Heat	Indie	2007-09-11 00:00:00	Uncut	62.0	Hot Hot Heat have recently toned down a lot of their jerkier tendencies and are a lot less annoying for it. [Nov 2007, p.107]
Chrome Dreams II	Neil Young	Rock	2007-10-23 00:00:00	Blender	76.0	But vintage doesn’t mean nostalgic. 'Dirty Old Man' is the pissed, hilarious antithesis of his wide-eyed ’70s signature 'Old Man,' and it rivals Nick Cave’s 'No Pussy Blues' (see Grinderman) as the year’s best song about a deranged, horny graybeard.
Polymers Are Forever	Future of the Left	Pop/Rock	2011-11-22 00:00:00	The Quietus	76.0	"Taken from the album sessions, the organ-bolstered ""Polymers Are Forever"" combines classic FOTL with a worrying tendency for grandiosity which was emerging on Travels...; a stylistic development which, along with an increasing funk elasticity, is a far cry from Falkous's efficiently cutting Mclusky."
Star Kitty's Revenge	Joi	Pop	2002-03-19 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	75.0	Some of the best baby-making music since Barry White.
Thorn in My Heart	Kim Richey	Country	2013-04-16 00:00:00	Uncut	76.0	While all perfectly pleasant and expertly played, there's a nagging wish that Richey would break out of her comfort zone more often. [May 2013, p.76]

Alive 2007	Daft Punk	Dance	2007-12-04 00:00:00	Urb	78.0	One answer, really...bass. Or, lack of bass. Having tested the disc on several systems, I can only determine that someone at Daft Punk central, or Virgin Records decided to master this disc like a pop record, the mids jacked to high heaven while the sub-bass, the stuff that actually makes you move, is completely erased.
Two Eleven	Brandy	R&B;	2012-10-16 00:00:00	HipHopDX	77.0	Two Eleven, while a well-crafted and produced album, falls short by comeback standards.
Pushing The Senses	Feeder	Rock	2005-01-31 00:00:00	The Guardian	52.0	Feeder have had all of their edges carefully removed.... The result is a kind of emotional aural soup that will baffle the spikier members of their original punky fanbase.

Psychocandy: Live at Barrowlands	The Jesus and Mary Chain	Pop/Rock	2015-07-31 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	83.0	As an accompaniment to the original album--which I'm sure most people reading this will already own (and if you don't, you should)--it stands proud as a comprehensive update to a timeless record.
Whenever You're Ready	Swell	Indie	2003-09-09 00:00:00	AllMusic	66.0	A swirling, beautiful, and warmly complex road trip of an album.
Hissing Fauna, Are You The Destroyer?	Of Montreal	Indie	2007-01-23 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	80.0	If there is one thing in this world that can elevate even the weakest of lyrics from the trough of personal diary hell, it’s a catchy melody. Thankfully this record overflows with them.
Fearless Love	Melissa Etheridge	Rock	2010-04-27 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	59.0	Fearless Love, Melissa Etheridge's feistiest disc since her 1988 debut, blurs the difference between hard-earned personal experience and social commentary.
Preliminaires	Iggy Pop	Rock	2009-06-02 00:00:00	PopMatters	66.0	Although Préliminaires has some effective moments, it comes off as an underdeveloped exercise that needs refinement.
If Not Now, When?	Incubus	Pop/Rock	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	48.0	As a temporary deviation from Incubus's core sound, If Not Now, When? is satisfactory.

Ben Kweller	Ben Kweller	Indie	2006-09-19 00:00:00	Filter	74.0	Effortless pop with an undenaible solo-era Stephen Malkmus quality that just makes you want to go on a long drive. [#22, p.100]
Romantic Comedy	Big Troubles	Pop/Rock	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Pitchfork	71.0	Appealing and in tune with admirable influences but ultimately lacking the sort of unpredictability or drama that can make these the songs that saved your life rather than reminiscent of ones that can.
Murdered Love	P.O.D.	Pop/Rock	2012-07-10 00:00:00	AllMusic	58.0	While the band's sound here leans toward the more grungy end of hardcore, P.O.D. have always evinced a knack for hooky pop songwriting, and the best tracks here are the more melodic, pop-oriented ones.

Brooklynati	Tanya Morgan	Rap	2009-05-19 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	79.0	This feels, to me, like the sort of rap record we rap nerds lament a dearth of: sprawling and smart, bursting with production that ebbs symphonically but never cluttered over five-minute tracks, a long, warm-hearted record whose length is justified by long, genial verses that build on one another via sharp delivery and three assured mic presences (and one outrageous guest).
See You On The Other Side	Korn	Rock	2005-12-06 00:00:00	Amazon.com	64.0	Its center becomes weighed down with bland mid-tempo numbers and the final song detracts from the powerhouse close the record might have had.

Build A Nation	Bad Brains	Rock	2007-06-26 00:00:00	AllMusic	73.0	While Bad Brains never quite match the intensity of their early days, this is easily the best record they've released since Quickness.
I Never Learn	Lykke Li	Pop/Rock	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	77.0	I Never Learn is by no means a failure--the highs are grand when they come--but it has a tendency towards bombast and shallow self indulgence that sees it edge dangerously close to the fringes of mediocrity.
The Ruffian's Misfortune	Ray Wylie Hubbard	Country	2015-04-07 00:00:00	Blurt Magazine	72.0	It’s a fierce, fun and unforgettable album that would be an achievement for a singer/songwriter of any age, but particularly for one on the far side of 60.

The Big Doe Rehab	Ghostface Killah	Rap	2007-12-04 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	77.0	Given that a relevant part of his appeal has always been his eccentricity and willingness to take risks, a record mostly defined by his adherence to the tried and true is bound to feel like a bit of a copout.
F.E.A.R.	Papa Roach	Pop/Rock	2015-01-27 00:00:00	AllMusic	58.0	Ultimately, it's just this kind of self-flagellating, dark-hued rock aesthetic that's worked for Papa Roach for well over a decade, and despite whatever passing styles or trends in pop music they've ignored in the process, it's a sound that seems to be working for them.
Choral	Mountains	Rock	2009-02-17 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	83.0	Choral, never succumbing to mere regurgitation, represents talented musicians confident in their methods, who channel their influences to produce a sound that proves accessible while remaining distinctive and utterly expressive.
Tell Me	Jessica Lea Mayfield	Pop/Rock	2011-02-08 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	73.0	Tell Me deserves praise for its alternative vision of what a singer-songwriter album can be.
Black Ice	AC/DC	Rock	2008-10-20 00:00:00	The Guardian	69.0	It's a record aimed at the band's existing audience, and far more important than any qualitative highs and lows is the fact that everything you might expect is present and correct.
The Eternal	Sonic Youth	Rock	2009-06-09 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	79.0	Yes, The Eternal is “Another Sonic Youth Record” but it’s also “Another Good Sonic Youth record”, revealing its finer details gradually, even if there’s no fundamentally new approach, arrangement, or message, in any of the songs.

Eyes & Nines	Trash Talk	Rock	2010-06-08 00:00:00	Pitchfork	83.0	Eyes & Nines could've come out at any point in at least the past 15 years, so if you're looking for innovation, look elsewhere. But for those of us who had formative, life-changing experiences screaming in our friends' faces in wood-paneled basements or tiled VFW Halls while bands like bands like Pageninetynine or Milhouse played, it's a real treat.
Crimson	Alkaline Trio	Rock	2005-05-24 00:00:00	JackC	78.0	"Almost perfect album, soooo goood! Songs like ""Sadie"" "" Dethbed"" are just geniusly well done!"
Love Is Free [EP]	Robyn	Pop	2015-08-07 00:00:00	Pitchfork	73.0	What Love Is Free does so well, and so simply, is hone in on just the beauty of finally letting go, physically and mentally.
Saves the Day	Saves the Day	Alternative/Indie Rock	2013-09-17 00:00:00	AllMusic	82.0	While it's no shock that the bandmembers had an album like this in them after all this time, Saves the Day's effervescence makes for a pleasant surprise, giving listeners a brief escape from their day into a world filled with poppy hooks and sparkling melody.
Little Death	Pete & the Pirates	Indie	2008-02-18 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	74.0	For sure, dollops of Franz, Blur and Supergrass have been whisked into this epileptic mix of guttural, quick-witted punk-pop but Little Death is no pre-packaged ready-bake; it’s an improvised, home-cooked palate-whetter, coated in rhythm and sprinkled with bite.
Love Is The Answer	Barbra Streisand	Pop	2009-09-29 00:00:00	Boston Globe	83.0	At 67, Streisand’s gorgeous tones and powers of interpretation are utterly intact, and also front-and-center thanks to producer Diana Krall’s class-conscious pairing of her own understated quartet with Johnny Mandel’s velvety orchestrations.
Seeds	TV on the Radio	Pop/Rock	2014-11-17 00:00:00	Mdelamaza	78.0	A beautiful journey into heartache and loss, that ends up in a triumphant note. Cynical people would probably say that the fact that this isA beautiful journey into heartache and loss, that ends up in a triumphant note. Cynical people would probably say that the fact that this is probably the most commercial record of TVOTR is a bad thing, but this is just a band trying to deal with their inner demons in the most direct and honest way they can. Even with all the sadness of some songs, It's impossible not to smile after hearing Seeds. Another great record from one of the most consistent bands of the past ten years.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Where It Hits You	Jim White	Folk	2012-02-21 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	71.0	Through the heartache, there is a sophisticated definition of sound; this is no guts-on-the-floor album of raw country blues.
The Take Off and Landing of Everything	Elbow	Pop/Rock	2014-03-11 00:00:00	The Observer (UK)	80.0	You would fully expect to find strings and piano on an Elbow track, but these can be any scoundrel's knee-jerk shortcut to gravitas. Much better are Guy Garvey's sloshed 40-nothing aperçus, playing off beautifully against a slinky organ melody.
Reflection	Fifth Harmony	Pop/Rock	2015-02-03 00:00:00	AllMusic	78.0	Although essentially a radio-ready pop aperitif and nowhere near the cultural touchstone of Beyonce's album, Reflection nonetheless works as a Revlon ad-level post-feminist girls' night out with plenty of vintage '90s R&B; swagger.
Mean Everything To Nothing	Manchester Orchestra	Indie	2009-04-21 00:00:00	Blender	70.0	With this foulmouthed, backsliding rock, Hull and his flock do Dixie real proud.
The Crying Light	Antony and the Johnsons	Indie	2009-01-20 00:00:00	Q Magazine	80.0	Emotion drips from every breath. [Feb 2009, p.118]
Worthy	Bettye LaVette	R&B;	2015-01-27 00:00:00	Boston Globe	80.0	Worthy is another finely curated set of songs.
I Love You, Honeybear	Father John Misty	Pop/Rock	2015-02-10 00:00:00	Spin	87.0	If Tillman's this brilliantly pointed as a paramour, we're scared to hear the breakup album.
Dark Was The Night	Various Artists	Indie	2009-02-17 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	74.0	It features top-shelf exclusive original and cover tracks by softer-side-of-indie acts currently riding a wave of relevance.
Volta	Björk	Rock	2007-05-08 00:00:00	Under The Radar	77.0	While Bjork's past sounds are arguably better than most, Volta is perhaps the first Bjork effort that looks backwards instead of forward into the future. [Summer 2007, p.79]
Why Make Sense?	Hot Chip	Electronic	2015-05-19 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	81.0	It’s goofy, yet sexy, accessible and experimental, and often all at once.
Out Of Control	Girls Aloud	Rock	2008-11-03 00:00:00	Sputnikmusic	63.0	For an album called Out of Control, it's astonishing just how bland and devoid of personality or expression this is.
Regeneration	The Divine Comedy	Indie	2001-11-06 00:00:00	AllMusic	77.0	By shedding the smirking artifice that served Casanova so well, and hiring producer Nigel Godrich, the Divine Comedy may be treading dangerously close to the sounds of countrymen Radiohead, but the Divine Comedy are smart enough to give listeners just enough lyrical bit to throw them off the scent.
Nothing Hurts	Male Bonding	Indie	2010-05-11 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	77.0	The album coasts through 13 songs in just 29 minutes, making for a seemingly perfect setlist of distorted, high-energy punk.
Pom Pom	Ariel Pink	Pop/Rock	2014-11-17 00:00:00	PopMatters	75.0	While Pink appears to be currently on some kind of self-destructive PR campaign, one cannot deny that pom pom is gorgeous and silly--sometimes both at the same time.
Love from London	Robyn Hitchcock	Pop/Rock	2013-03-05 00:00:00	BBC Music	77.0	While his customary playfulness in dissecting matters of the heart and cerebellum is a reassuring hallmark of Love From London, the album also proffers a brooding, politicised, sometimes incensed Hitchcock.
The  Sound of the Life of the Mind	Ben Folds Five	Pop/Rock	2012-09-18 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	61.0	This is a solid, if unspectacular, comeback and fans will be crossing their fingers that The Sound Of The Life Of The Mind is a new beginning, rather than a one-off cash-in.
Phantom Radio	Mark Lanegan Band	Pop/Rock	2014-10-21 00:00:00	The 405	78.0	It's decent and fairly enjoyable, but nothing astounds.
Modern Times	Bob Dylan	Rock	2006-08-29 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	89.0	Modern Times is a record of both giddy songwriting peaks and overall uniformity, a record whose music ultimately delivers and enriches its well-bred messages of realism and religion, work and devotion, the certitude of decay and the decay of certitude.
Once We Were Trees	Beachwood Sparks	Indie	2001-10-09 00:00:00	AllMusic	77.0	The SoCal indie cowboys deliver an album completely displaying musical, songwriting, and repertory growth from their critically acclaimed self-titled debut.
Record	Zero 7	Electronic	2010-07-20 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	69.0	This is an illuminating and captivating insight into the world of Zero 7. Far from being coffee table fodder, it provides a near perfect chill out soundtrack - easy to relax to, but always rewarding closer inspection, especially deep in the small hours.
The  Truth About Love	P!nk	Pop	2012-09-18 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	77.0	If The Truth About Love finds her more content than on Funhouse (which fed off of conflicting, confusing, and not altogether flattering feelings about the mess of her personal life), she's still ambivalent about her contentment.
Dangerous And Moving	T.A.T.U	Dance	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	53.0	Although spunky cuties Julia Volkova and Lena Katina have improved their English-pronunciation skills, the hooks they're handed this second time around are decidedly duller.
Jessie James	Jessie James	Rock	2009-08-11 00:00:00	AllMusic	73.0	That eagerness to sell out can be grating, especially when her 2009 debut slides into glassy ballads, but fortunately she's also picked up (perhaps unwittingly) on the underlying oddness of Aguilera and Perry, turning out purportedly mainstream pop that puts together familiar ingredients in weird ways.
Psychedelic Pill	Neil Young & Crazy Horse	Pop/Rock	2012-10-30 00:00:00	BBC Music	79.0	This isn't a conventional album by the ordinary standards of today, but it's fantastic. Crazy Horse are the perfect band for this sort of wistful noise, carrying both Young's simple melodies and his love of stretching out with equal ease.
The Diet	HeCTA	Electronic	2015-09-18 00:00:00	Record Collector	73.0	The faster, rhythmic tracks are less convincing, though they can excite on occasion, but it’s this mish-mash of successes that make the album jar, and not in the way HeCTA would have desired.
Black Light	Groove Armada	Dance	2010-03-02 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	75.0	The album is pure Groove Armada pop at the end, but the decision to be slightly less saccharine means that it's not nearly as disposable as some previous outings.
The Complex	Blue Man Group	Rock	2003-04-22 00:00:00	Splendid	60.0	"While a few of the songs -- like BMG's team-up with Esthero for a cover of ""White Rabbit"" -- may generate momentary interest, they all sound a little too much like commercial radio fodder, their quirks depressingly predictable."
Awfully Deep	Roots Manuva	Rap	2005-04-19 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	80.0	The music is often awesomely original.
Polaris	Tesseract	Pop/Rock	2015-09-18 00:00:00	Revolver	71.0	Polaris is, at last, the platonic ideal of a TesseracT album, the one where they get everything just right.
Two Against Nature	Steely Dan	Rock	2000-02-29 00:00:00	CDNow	77.0	Becker and Fagen seem to have found their happy place during the recording of Two Against Nature. And as it's presented on this extremely infectious collection, their joy is contagious.
Working Girl	Little Boots	Pop	2015-07-10 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	64.0	A more sonically focused effort.
Pru	Pru	Pop	2000-11-07 00:00:00	MableM	8.6	Your Voice is so Powerful it draws you in to every song
Ascent	Six Organs of Admittance	Pop/Rock	2012-08-21 00:00:00	Kerrang!	80.0	After listening to Ascent, you'll be hard-pressed to locate a better batch of mesmerising mind-expanding jams this year. [25 Aug 2012, p.54]
Fomo	Liam Finn	Pop/Rock	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Q Magazine	73.0	Fearless strides forth from Neil's number one son. [Aug. 2011, p. 119]
Congratulations	MGMT	Rock	2010-04-13 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	72.0	In striving rather openly to set their sophomore effort apart from what they view as the critically acclaimed trappings of their debut, MGMT offers what is, essentially, an album of B-sides--a few bright spots strung together with half-baked concepts and monotony, in need of a lot less knob-tweaking and a whole lot more rewrites.
A Constant Sea	Heliotropes	Pop/Rock	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Blurt Magazine	70.0	After the third track “Christine” floats past like a lost Julee Cruise track on soulful blues guitar and vintage 50s’ keys, the LP takes a surprising but effective turn into heavy, murky territory.
Overlook	Maria Taylor	Pop/Rock	2011-08-16 00:00:00	Absolute Punk (Staff reviews)	58.0	The instrumentation is luscious and variable, the harmonies are wonderful, the lyrics are solid and compelling for the most part, and with such a lovely blend of slower and up-tempo tracks to choose from, Overlook is something you definitely don't want to do in regards to what might just be considered Maria Taylor's finest solo effort to date.
Spine Hits	Sleepy Sun	Electronic	2012-04-10 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	61.0	Spine Hits is still a great collection of rock songs, and while there's a grain or two of filler, it delivers in immediacy and replay value.
Helplessness Blues	Fleet Foxes	Pop/Rock	2011-05-03 00:00:00	Spin	85.0	Musically, the hooks are softer, the arrangements more ambitious, and 1960s British psychedelic folk (Fairport Convention, Vashti Bunyan, Pentangle) a far more palpable influence than the Americana that fueled the band's 2008 debut.
Hell: The Sequel EP	Bad Meets Evil	Rap	2011-06-14 00:00:00	The Telegraph (UK)	72.0	The duo's sinister raps are as shockingly impressive as they are morally disturbing.
Press Play	Diddy	Rap	2006-10-17 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	62.0	Save for the unnecessary interludes, the strength of Press Play is in its ability to employ so many different styles, sounds, influences and mold them into one extremely coherent package.
TheFutureEmbrace	Billy Corgan	Rock	2005-06-21 00:00:00	PopMatters	59.0	It's not that any of the songs are horrible; it's just that they are so shamelessly middle-of-the-road that you become sickened by the ambivalence that they instill.
Transfiguration Of Vincent	M. Ward	Indie	2003-03-18 00:00:00	Q Magazine	82.0	A rich quilt of Americana, as if the folk, country and rock strands were brought together in a starlit saloon somewhere near the border. [Jun 2003, p.106]
Andorra	Caribou	Indie	2007-08-21 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	83.0	Despite its music-geek-pleasing period references and psychedelic density, this is ultimately a frothy pop record full of hopeful love songs.
Faking The Books	Lali Puna	Electronic	2004-04-20 00:00:00	Delusions of Adequacy	83.0	Faking the Books is one of the best albums to come out so far this year.
Twins	Ty Segall	Pop/Rock	2012-10-09 00:00:00	Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM)	80.0	It's the best album of its kind to come out this year and, perhaps even more significantly, Segall's best work to date.
Wincing The Night Away	The Shins	Indie	2007-01-23 00:00:00	Observer Music Monthly	79.0	Their most mature set to date.
Top Ten Hits of the End of the World	Prince Rama	Pop/Rock	2012-11-05 00:00:00	Boston Globe	65.0	"The album is consistent in its Eastern-minded psych-pop, and aside from a few flourishes to distinguish the ""bands""--goth synths in ""Receive,"" a song supposedly by a German architect band called Taohaus, for example--it sounds like the effort of a single group."
The Breakthrough	Mary J. Blige	R&B;	2005-12-20 00:00:00	Village Voice	76.0	The Breakthrough improves on 2003's Diddy-helmed misfire Love & Life but lacks the character of 1999's eclectic Mary.
Blossom	Frank Carter & the Rattlesnakes	Pop/Rock	2015-08-14 00:00:00	Kerrang!	84.0	Don't call it a comeback. Call it a rebirth. [15 Aug 2015, p.51]
Under A Billion Suns	Mudhoney	Rock	2006-03-07 00:00:00	Filter	73.0	[Mudhoney] are as furious, as weird, and as tuned-down as ever. [#19, p.101]
Good Arrows	Tunng	Indie	2007-09-25 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	75.0	It's an album sufficiently laced with despair to render the not-committed listener uncomfortable; delve deeper, though, to where the darkness makes way for an eerie underworld glow, and the record's beauty emerges.
The Week That Was	The Week That Was	Indie	2008-08-26 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	82.0	Executed with serious flair, it manages the rare feat of being both mentally stimulating and musically satisfying. It is, in every regard, one of the most daring albums you’ll hear this year.
Skying	The Horrors	Pop/Rock	2011-08-09 00:00:00	Uncut	83.0	Skying, The Horrors' third, again brilliantly confounds expectations. [Aug 2011, p.76]
Sort Of Revolution	Fink	Electronic	2009-09-15 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	68.0	Downbeat dinner parties, say hello to your new soundtrack.

Brassbound	The Ordinary Boys	Indie	2005-06-20 00:00:00	The Guardian	50.0	When the 39 minutes are over, rather than play it again, you're itching to put on London Calling to hear the real thing.
The Fallen Leaf Pages	Radar Bros.	Indie	2005-03-22 00:00:00	WayneB	67.0	Another solid release from the most unhearlded L.A. band (with exception to Acetone, R.I.P.) over the past dozen years ! Buy this record andAnother solid release from the most unhearlded L.A. band (with exception to Acetone, R.I.P.) over the past dozen years !

Cherry Bomb	Tyler, The Creator	Rap	2015-04-14 00:00:00	PopMatters	69.0	Musically, Cherry Bomb finds Tyler taking a step in the right direction by ever-so-slightly removing himself from the world of his early albums and mixtapes, but it’s only a half-measure.
F.A.M.E.	Chris Brown	Pop	2011-03-22 00:00:00	DJ Booth	52.0	This album is about keeping Brown relevant and making the musical man child marketable again, and on that level it's a moderate success. He's still got a long way to go before he regains his previous stature.
Be Your Own Pet	Be Your Own Pet	Indie	2006-06-06 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	75.0	Be Your Own Pet attacks with enthusiasm, and everything here rocks sufficently, although some remedial songwriting classes may be required before they make the move to sports arenas.
12 Songs	Neil Diamond	Rock	2005-11-08 00:00:00	E! Online	81.0	It's stripped down (and we're not just talking about the jumpsuits), simple and the songwriter's best work in ages.
We Used To Think The Freeway Sounded Like A River	Richmond Fontaine	Rock	2009-09-29 00:00:00	PopMatters	86.0	A sustained masterpiece is unlikely. Instead, this is a record with only flashes of brilliance, but what flashes they are.
Welcome Joy	The Cave Singers	Indie	2009-08-18 00:00:00	AllMusic	65.0	"Most of the album stays true to a light flavor, and Welcome Joy is a nice, comfortable listen, right up there with ""Invitation Songs."""
Free Your Mind	Cut Copy	Electronic	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Filter	68.0	Groundbreaking, this ain’t. But then again, are you trying to raze a barn or get your groove on? Album-specific flourishes don’t surprise.
Secret Wars	Oneida	Indie	2004-01-20 00:00:00	Village Voice	83.0	All in all, expertly wobbling prog metal, constructed out of as few chords as possible.
Trust	Low	Indie	2002-09-24 00:00:00	Ricko	76.0	"While a slight letdown after ""Things We Lost In the Fire"", ""Trust"" comfortably fits in with the rest of Low's work. It has all the keyWhile a slight letdown after ""Things We Lost In the Fire"", ""Trust"" comfortably fits in with the rest of Low's work. It has all the key elements of a great Low in that its heavy, beautiful, dreary and seeping in atmosphere. ""Trust"" is an album that requires rather than demands your attention in order to be fully seen and one that I found hard to pin down. It can be hard work but it's an equally satisfying listen.  At the record's heart is the brilliant ""Last Snowstorm of the Year"" and it feels like everything builds and then recovers from this piece in the middle.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"
The  Constant	I Blame Coco	Pop/Rock	2010-11-09 00:00:00	AllMusic	63.0	The Constant has enough strong moments to make it a promising debut from a group with plenty of confidence, personality and potential.
Family Crimes	The Skygreen Leopards	Pop/Rock	2014-07-08 00:00:00	Blurt Magazine	72.0	Here, together again, they pick up more or less where they left off, slipping subdued hooks into strummy reveries and spiking easy breezy tunes with jarring, occasional violent lyrics.
The Damnwells	The Damnwells	Pop/Rock	2015-04-14 00:00:00	Absolute Punk (Staff reviews)	80.0	"Even if The Damnwells feels a bit anticlimactic as a big reunion album, even if it isn't quite as good as either One Last Century or No One Listens to the Band Anymore, and even if it could have been improved substantially through the addition of a few more EP songs (particularly ""Along the Way,"" a bittersweet Boyhood parallel that stands as arguably the best song Alex Dezen has ever written), it still largely succeeds on its own terms."
Freedom	Akon	R&B;	2008-12-02 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	58.0	Akon's philosophy of liberty also includes the freedom to reuse nearly identical hooks for 13 songs straight. That approach may bring him plenty money, but it yields only a few legitimately fun tracks, buried beneath a pile of boring retreads.
Eyelid Movies	Phantogram	Indie	2010-02-09 00:00:00	Absolute Punk (Staff reviews)	76.0	Phantogram have put forth a collection of heady and stimulating songs primed for in-the-dark listening.
King	O.A.R.	Pop/Rock	2011-08-02 00:00:00	PopMatters	60.0	On King, O.A.R. play with even more radio-friendly structures, a move guaranteed to alienate some fans while gaining plenty of others.
Forth	The Verve	Rock	2008-08-26 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	71.0	Admittedly, the band's past catalogue sets the bar high, but Forth is an achievement, especially when considered in the context of so many failed attempts by others to return after a period of inactivity.
Have You in My Wilderness	Julia Holter	Electronic	2015-09-25 00:00:00	DIY Magazine	87.0	Julia Holter always stood out as a left-field crafter of melody; this album establishes her as a unique lyric voice, too.
Bestial Burden	Pharmakon	Pop/Rock	2014-10-14 00:00:00	Resident Advisor	80.0	By injecting a self-serious genre with a sense of theatre, Bestial Burden makes Chardiet's music more engaging without dulling its edge.
Undun	The Roots	Rap	2011-12-06 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	88.0	The Roots manage to craft another interesting hip-hop experiment with undun.
All The Lost Souls	James Blunt	Rock	2007-09-18 00:00:00	Hartford Courant	53.0	It's more of the same on his second album, a collection so bland, it makes hardtack seem sumptuous.
The Forgotten Arm	Aimee Mann	Rock	2005-05-03 00:00:00	Village Voice	70.0	The songs on The Forgotten Arm are too engaging to dismiss their familiarity.
Romantica	Luna	Rock	2002-04-23 00:00:00	Splendid	76.0	The songs are simpler, livelier, a little more direct and a lot more hummable.
BLACKsummers'night	Maxwell	R&B;	2009-07-07 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	85.0	His sentiments rarely transcend the boudoir--and listeners lulled by the album's unvaryingly sleek, high-gloss beats may just drift off to dreamland before they get there.
Forgiveness Rock Record	Broken Social Scene	Indie	2010-05-04 00:00:00	Mojo	77.0	A sprawling and lengthy affair, this album rarely falters. [June 2010, p. 98]
Which Side Are You On?	Ani DiFranco	Pop/Rock	2012-01-16 00:00:00	The Telegraph (UK)	69.0	Her worthier sentiments are balanced by maturing wit, self-awareness and the distinctive snap'n'slap of her funky guitar grooves.
I Can't Imagine	Shelby Lynne	R&B;	2015-05-04 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	77.0	Throughout her multi-decade-long career, Grammy-winning Lynne has combined eras, influences and genres to create a sound familiar, yet unique. Imagine continues in that tradition.
No, You C'Mon	Lambchop	Indie	2004-02-17 00:00:00	Alternative Press	79.0	As is the case whenever [Kurt] Wagner's velvet croon wraps itself around a night that ends so late it's already morning... there really isn't a critic in the world who can touch him. [combined review of both discs; Mar 2003, p.94]
Encore	Eminem	Rap	2004-11-12 00:00:00	Dot Music	64.0	You&#146;d believe this was a &#147;Weird Al&#148; Jankovic record had you tuned in halfway through.
Wrote a Song for Everyone	John Fogerty	Pop/Rock	2013-05-28 00:00:00	Country Weekly	71.0	The only real clunker is a lugubrious redo of “Lodi,” featuring John’s sons Tyler and Shane, but otherwise, this should be a must for Fogerty followers.
Gangs	And So I Watch You from Afar	Pop/Rock	2011-05-02 00:00:00	Rock Sound	68.0	The self-imposed time restraints have merely served to sharpen the quartet's focus in quite glorious fashion.
Never	Micachu & the Shapes	Pop/Rock	2012-07-24 00:00:00	The Quietus	76.0	This is pop music, pure and simple: smarter, stranger than your average fare, no doubt, but don't confuse its oddness for inscrutable obtuseness.
Infinity Machines	Gnod	Pop/Rock	2015-04-20 00:00:00	The Quietus	84.0	Infinity Machines is a painful modern masterpiece, and it's urging us to listen to the voices in our heads.
Severant	Kuedo	Electronic	2011-10-17 00:00:00	AllMusic	83.0	"An intriguing sonic experience from start to finish, Severant is a bold left-field first offering from an artist who's quickly establishing himself as the intelligent dance scene's ""one to watch."""
Mountain Battles	The Breeders	Rock	2008-04-08 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	75.0	Mountain Battles gets less right than Pod or Last Splash did, but hits the target more often than Pacer or Title TK. Either way, it's probably a bit better than you expect.
I Want to Grow Up	Colleen Green	Pop/Rock	2015-02-24 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	72.0	She kisses off her twenties with fuzz-pop guitars and breathy sighs in the Nineties mode of Juliana Hatfield or the Muffs.
Scramble	The Coathangers	Indie	2009-04-07 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	71.0	If it weren't for the stalker-punk of 'Pussywillow' and 'Time Passing', both glowering oddly from the mess and nodding towards early B-52s, we'd shove this in the wardrobe.
Black Pudding	Mark Lanegan	Pop/Rock	2013-05-14 00:00:00	Uncut	71.0	It is the instrumentation that offers the complexity, bringing texture to this deceptively simple-sounding album. [Jun 2013, p.72]
The  Truth About Love	P!nk	Pop	2012-09-18 00:00:00	Expert Witness (MSN Music)	77.0	Until the last two songs, whose overwrought drama I don't have to like just because I trust its verisimilitude, they hit every time.
The Visitor	Matias Aguayo	Electronic	2013-06-25 00:00:00	Uncut	76.0	Aguayo always has heaps of ideas, some of which work brilliantly but more often than not, he finds himself stranded in a groove, unsure where to go next. [Aug 2013, p.67]
Causers of This	Toro y Moi	Indie	2010-02-09 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	71.0	Toro Y Moi puts intelligence and inventiveness into a youthful music genre dumbing itself down at an unduly early stage.

A Color Map of the Sun	Pretty Lights	Pop/Rock	2013-07-02 00:00:00	smoothoperator	72.0	"Derek Vincent Smith is truly one of the most gifted producers of music I have ever across. He spans infinite genres, makes music that is easyDerek Vincent Smith is truly one of the most gifted producers of music I have ever across. He spans infinite genres, makes music that is easy to listen to and for every occasion.  I appreciate his explorative nature of this cd and from a purely production standpoint, its genius. However, this album is filled with countless awkward breaks, beats and rhythms.  There are 6 or 7 stand out gems from this album, which before now, I could not name a track he has made that is not pure flame.I respect the amount of time and effort he put into this work, but I am just not all that impressed with it.  My expectations for him are always higher than the highest peaks and I feel he tried too hard on this release, trying to do to much with his own sound.  I respect that he constantly that he is continuously innovating his music and his mentality on these tracks, but it lacks the usual PL originality that will have you nodding your head uncontrollably as you study for your next test, write your next paper, or patiently drudge through your daily commute.I have been listening to PL since the days of ""Taking Up Your Precious Time"" and been attending his live shows just as long.  His music on this album, while has more depth and layers, lacks that completely original feel and vibe that you could just get down to.  ACMOTS is more downtempo, which I appreciate and do love, but most of these tracks will surely bore the drugged out, frat boy crowd that has infested his once, amazingly lively and energetic live performances.  If you're the type just looking for the next 'rager' to party with your boys to, do us all a favor and dont get into PL. Go to the next daft punk show, because you don't appreciate the music, you just want to party.A color map of the sun truly is a unique, exploratory dive into electronic music that is unlike any other, and much better than the generic techno sound that saturates the already played-out market.  PL's music is for a special person who appreciates all the subtle hits, drops, samples, beats, vocals n breaks he dashes into his productions, and they will surely dig this album.  I absolutely recommend you check out A Color Map of The Sun if you are a PL fan, but it is apparent he will likely never re-kindle the magic of his yesteryears.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"

Chemistry Of Common Life	Fucked Up	Rock	2008-10-07 00:00:00	AllMusic	85.0	The Chemistry of Common Life, is a lush, expansive masterpiece that dismisses the theory that punkers have to follow a concrete formula of short and fast songs with raw-edged production.
Visions	Grimes	Electronic	2012-02-21 00:00:00	Spin	80.0	"The pervasive sense on Visions is of a young woman carefully pushing out of her own introversion, which makes the moments where she sings from the gut instead of the throat (""Circumambient""), or strives for human-on-human sensuality (""Skin""), all the more thrilling."
Get Away From Me	Nellie McKay	Pop	2004-02-10 00:00:00	Pitchfork	79.0	With better lyrics and a longer attention span, McKay would be a jaw-dropping songwriter, but it's difficult to get sucked into a song if you don't connect with the singer.

Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga	Spoon	Indie	2007-07-10 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	84.0	Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga is one of those ''taking stock'' records that collates and refines everything that came before. But what an inventory of sounds they've built.
Moonwink	Spinto Band	Indie	2008-10-07 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	62.0	Had this been a debut album perhaps it would have been better received, however, the shadow of the successful first album looms heavy here and may just have listeners reaching for the older material rather than the current.

Get Awkward	Be Your Own Pet	Rock	2008-03-18 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	70.0	There's plenty of kicks left over, but it tilts the impression of the band. The Teen Beat questionnaires that come in the disc jacket (What's your favorite color? What's your shoe size?) and the shortened tracklist end up emphasizing the nerdiness over the jerkiness.
Dear God, I Hate Myself	Xiu Xiu	Indie	2010-02-23 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	74.0	Now seven full-lengths into their career, Xiu Xiu have hit a milestone with Dear God, I Hate Myself.

Magic Chairs	Efterklang	Rock	2010-02-23 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	73.0	It's a little too easy to hear the band in Arcade Fire mode here and Coldplay mode there, which raises the uncomfortable question of what, exactly, Efterklang sounds like in Efterklang mode. That's not a question that Magic Chairs resolves, but it ends up being quite a lot of fun just listening to them play around with some possible answers.

Excuse My French	French Montana	Rap	2013-05-21 00:00:00	Exclaim	54.0	Montana's selection of trap beats falls flat. It's the kind of sweatshop beat-making mainstream producers have learned to accept as they cash their cheques.
Ray Guns Are Not Just The Future	The Bird And The Bee	Indie	2009-01-27 00:00:00	Los Angeles Times	71.0	Like any other subgenre, it has its good and its bad, its watered-down faux bubbly and its liquid gold. And the Bird and the Bee’s second album, Ray Guns Are Not Just the Future, is on the liquid gold side.
Live Music	The Strange Boys	Pop/Rock	2011-10-24 00:00:00	BBC Music	67.0	So far, so chin-strokingly barroom--but then things take a turn for the interesting and Live Music becomes a more-frills-than-you-might-imagine, no filler delight.

I Will Be	Dum Dum Girls	Rock	2010-03-30 00:00:00	Spin	79.0	On her Dum Dum debut, assisted by Blondie and Go-Go's producer Richard Gottehrer, she cages contagious odes to husband-Crocodiles singer Brandon Welchez (as well as anxious ruminations on losing him) in metallic distortion.
Ones and Sixes	Low	Pop/Rock	2015-09-11 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	78.0	It’s another subtly heart-rending effort from a band that remains one of the very finest in the world. If you needed a reminder of why Low are an institution then this is it.
Rise Above	Dirty Projectors	Indie	2007-09-11 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	78.0	The result is one of the most formally radical indie records in recent memory. It also happens to be Dirty Projectors’ all-around best, not least because it most closely recreates the kinetic force of their live performances.
Chutes Too Narrow	The Shins	Indie	2003-10-21 00:00:00	Pitchfork	88.0	Not simply an excellent album, Chutes Too Narrow is also a powerful testament to pop music's capacity for depth, beauty and expressiveness.

Best Coasts sound on their debut was prettyI absolutely loved Crazy for You - thought it was a superb album and not just a summer record. Best Coasts sound on their debut was pretty basic (drums, bass, guitar and vocals) but it was all they needed to get their sound out. I did wonder in what direction the band would go next and how they would build on Crazy for You. The Only Place has many of the elements that made its predecessor so likeable but the production is definitely different. There are more layers on this record and it's got a slicker sound. Unfortunately at times the energy and the songs get a bit lost underneath. This record has got good tunes on it but they are still using the same chord sequences and song formula they applied on their first. Essentially there isn't much progression but I'd still recommend the record and would definitely recommend the band.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
If The Ocean Gets Rough	Willy Mason	Indie	2007-03-20 00:00:00	The Guardian	66.0	On his debut album... Mason's dour tendencies were neatly offset by his ramshackle musicianship, but here the rambunctious clatter gives way to a sound more smooth, adult and portentous
Down There	Avey Tare	Pop/Rock	2010-10-26 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	76.0	To be completely honest, it's no revelation – at times the music feels incomplete, like a lonesome Portner is missing his bros – but it's played out beautifully, sunny in disposition and just a little wild around the edge.
Desperate Ground	The Thermals	Pop/Rock	2013-04-16 00:00:00	Magnet	73.0	This half-hour slab of very high-energy punk would be cathartic if its root darkness weren't so persistently unsettling. [No. 98, p.60]

The Historical Conquests of Josh Ritter	Josh Ritter	Rock	2007-08-21 00:00:00	Lost At Sea	79.0	The Historical Conquests of Josh Ritter finds namesake and frontman Ritter boldly claiming musical territory with a reinvented sound, turning from the meticulous arrangements and somber ruminations of his previous album to a more daring, moxie-charged approach that yields some of the freshest, most captivating songs of his career.
a ghost is born	Wilco	Indie	2004-06-22 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	81.0	For the most part, Ghost channels its shaggy sound into pop music. True, it's pop music that constantly threatens to erupt into noise or fade into silence, but it's still hard not to hum along.

Last 2 Walk	Three 6 Mafia	Rap	2008-06-24 00:00:00	Vibe	56.0	"All pounding drums and rolling keyboards, this is the Three 6 sound at its most dumbed down. The same could be said for the majority of Walk, which avoids the experimental sounds the group dabbled in on 2005’s ""Most Known Unknown"" and treads more familiar ground."
Wake Up The Nation	Paul Weller	Rock	2010-06-01 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	84.0	It's a collection of ludicrously fresh-sounding, short and sharp material (the majority of tracks are under two-and a-half minutes) that confirms he's in the midst of a seriously impressive rebirth.

It&#039;s the closest thing to bliss on a piece of plastic as you&#039;re going to get. J is the best guitar player you will ever hear in Indie Rock. Lou&#039;s bass playing has only improved in the 19 years since Bug&#039;s recording. The second song made me wonder if the album could ever reach the legendary strides of You&#039;re Living All Over Me. Then the third song started (Pick Me Up), and I was lost in a time when I had lived for bands like D.J., Sonic Youth, Pavement, to name a few. I was in heaven. By the time that the guitar solo ends at the end of the song, you find yourself asking: ""Why woould I ever listen to anything else?"" I am biased, since Dinosaur Jr has been my favorite band since I was 16 (I am now 32). I&#039;ve always liked YLAOM the best of all their albums. (although Bug, Gren Mind, and Where You Been are worthy of mention). THis album may surpass even YLAOM though. It&#039;s balanced, and the sense of cohesion between the members (even Murph) is amazing. It&#039;s energetic despite J&#039;s typical slacker style of whining the words out (which I have always liked). This is definitely the best album I bouth this year, and may be the best thing in 16 years that I&#039;ve bought. Yes More Light was a good rock album by J, but this trumps it in every manner. If you like guitar focused, post-punk with a folk influence thrown in for good measure - PICK THIS UP IMMEDIATELY!!!&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"

Anarchy, My Dear	Say Anything	Pop/Rock	2012-03-13 00:00:00	The Boston Phoenix	66.0	"Initially, the album seems to lack focus, save a steady burn of fury. But the anarchy's in the lack of cohesion, opening with the hand-clapping force of ""Burn a Miracle"" and progressing manically toward the melodic woe of ""Peace Out""."
Slave Vows	The Icarus Line	Pop/Rock	2013-08-06 00:00:00	The Quietus	83.0	Slave Vows, then, is a masterpiece, its black-hearted explosions and sordid vibes coming from a darker place than most of those pantomiming their way through rock & roll.

The  Lost Notebooks of Hank Williams	Various Artists	Country	2011-10-04 00:00:00	The Independent (UK)	79.0	It's the communal sentiment underlying such ostensibly personal heartache that gives Williams's songs much of their power, that draws the listener in as an emotional fellow-traveller.

Ultraviolet	Kylesa	Pop/Rock	2013-05-28 00:00:00	Derezzination	78.0	Sludge Metal outfit Kylesa bring a dirty, loud and pounding album in the form of Ultraviolet. The album at times is brutal, look at openerSludge Metal outfit Kylesa bring a dirty, loud and pounding album in the form of Ultraviolet. The album at times is brutal, look at opener “Exhale”. The drums beating into your skull backed by the deep guitars and bass that are accompanied by the brilliant male and female vocals of Phillip Cope and Laura Pleasants.The album swoops into “Unspoken” which is easily the best track on the album. The eerie lead guitar building up the earth shatteringly murky chorus blows your mind with the energy. And inter-weaved into all this chaos is some beautiful melodic female vocals which with the easy going tempo really create a solid trippy groove. I feel that the songs really work because of Lauren’s vocals. They add that extra depth dynamically because if Phillip’s vocals were used a lot, then they would get lost, look at “Grounded”, my least favourite track on the album because the vocals do seem to go to well, it gets a bit too murky, even around the lively riffs.“We’re Taking This”, along with “Exhale” are good examples of how both can work well together, I’m familiar with male/female vocal combinations in other genres, and I’m really glad that I can see another pairing working here.What this album does really well is blend in elements of Stoner Rock with tracks like “Long Gone” and “Drifting”, where in contrast you have the energetic “What Does it Take” that speeds along, at a pace that is more akin to Punk then Sludge or Stoner. It has a really strong melodic, distorted guitar lead that keeps up pace with the heavy and murky rhythm guitar. It shows that the band can change dynamics over the course of an album seamlessly and it works really well because it breaks the album up so you don’t get bored and tired with the same old same old.Saying that, “Steady Breakdown” feels like it’s trying to break any breakdown for the first half of the track before finding it’s feet in melodies. That where the band excel. In the ability to create a ruckuss that lies deep in the frequency chart and simultaneously sprinkle gentle harmonies on top to create a dreamy delight of Metal.However, from after “Low Tide”, the album can drag on ever so much. It starts to get repetitive and the albums beautifully dark charm gets lost, and it’s not until the end where you are reconciled with it.Overall, Kylesa deliver a very impressive but slightly weary album due to the fact that the sludge can occasionally overwhelm you towards the end.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Can I Keep This Pen?	Northern State	Indie	2007-08-28 00:00:00	AllMusic	67.0	Scatterbrained as Can I Keep This Pen? is, it would have fit perfectly in the catalog of the deceased Grand Royal, but somehow seems appropriate landing in Ipecac's strange and wonderfully eclectic lap.

Lead single ""Get Right"" is by far the best of the tracks on record--the horn sequence is addictive and memorable. Lopez herself actually pulls off a sound that&#039;s close to being more than mediocre but that&#039;s got a LOT to do with how good the song is. ""Cherry Pie"" stands out as one of Rebirth&#039;s best, in addition to ""Ryde or Die,"" ""He&#039;ll Be"" and ""Can&#039;t Believe."" The grooves are stellar and the faux-Hip Hop R&B; sounds make for a pretty good listen. Sure, Lopez is far from being an actual respected singer--but at least this album puts her much, much closer to being a credible performer.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"

Learning	Perfume Genius	Pop/Rock	2010-06-22 00:00:00	BBC Music	82.0	So sublime are these ten spectral soundtracks to the minutiae of a modern lover's tribulations that their sorrow is translated into something more uplifting than unsettling.
Television Man	Naomi Punk	Pop/Rock	2014-08-05 00:00:00	Pitchfork	71.0	Its style is limited, but the band manages to spread out within it, discovering their own idiosyncratic little vocabulary without ever exhausting it.
James Pants	James Pants	Electronic	2011-05-03 00:00:00	Uncut	72.0	Pants gas ditched electro-funk in favour of the kind of woozy, nu-gazing reveries crafted by Beach House, Girls and teenage Fantasy. Not that it's all whacked-pout bliss-pop. [Jul 2011, p.93]
The Complete Recordings	Frank Black and the Catholics	Pop/Rock	2015-05-04 00:00:00	Uncut	76.0	Only those with blind faith could love everything here, but dipping in randomly produces gems. [May 2015, p.91]
Conversations	Woman's Hour	Alternative/Indie Rock	2014-07-15 00:00:00	The 405	70.0	They don't shatter boundaries or expectations, but instead provide a grand, bedrock-solid opus stuffed with 10-tonne emotional blows and tranquillity most indie-pop groups shun.
Walk the River	Guillemots	Alternative/Indie Rock	2011-04-18 00:00:00	BBC Music	68.0	Eventually, their self-indulgence completely loses the listener. No matter how hard one might try to love this album--and one can try very hard--there's only disappointment at what could have been.

It feelsI've heard of Killer Mike before this album, but had never listened to him knowingly...from that POV this album is remarkable.  It feels nostalgic and fresh at the same time.

Somebody's Miracle	Liz Phair	Rock	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	54.0	Foregrounding the self-doubt that was a quiet but insistent subtext on the eponymous album, producer John Shanks provides unobtrusive arrangements and lets Phair strum more electric guitar; this is a singer-songwriter record, like Exile On Guyville. It’s also warmer than its predecessor.
An Other Cup	Yusuf	Rock	2006-11-14 00:00:00	Blender	65.0	The bullying production threatens to obliterate what’s good here: A half-dozen gentle seeker’s songs with meditative acoustic textures and lyrics advocating reasonableness among humankind, which was always Cat Stevens’s domain.
Lost And Found	Will Smith	Rap	2005-03-29 00:00:00	PopMatters	50.0	Somewhere along the way, Smith lost his musical appeal, be it via constant, blatant commercialism or simply a decline in skills. Now, it seems, he's found the qualities that made him such a joy in the first place; the only question remaining is whether anyone is still listening.

Burn Your Town	The Chapman Family	Pop/Rock	2011-03-07 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	61.0	They're not so much fiddling while Rome burns as clattering bass and drums magnificently while they take a torch to Redcar.
In the Grace of Your Love	The Rapture	Electronic	2011-09-05 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	65.0	I will say In The Grace of Your Love makes the last five years without The Rapture seem a lot more empty, sometimes you don't know what you're missing until it returns.
Trouble in Shangri-La	Stevie Nicks	Rock	2001-05-01 00:00:00	Billboard	70.0	Offering her strongest material since her 1982 landmark, Bella Donna, Nicks is radiant as she vamps through guitar-charged rockers that deftly balance her signature poetry with sticky pop hooks.

One Day It Will Please Us To Remember Even This	New York Dolls	Rock	2006-07-25 00:00:00	AllMusic	75.0	If it's not quite a triumph, it's challenging and ambitious stuff that rocks on out and doesn't tarnish the memory of what Johansen and Sylvain accomplished so many years ago.
Timez Are Weird These Days	Theophilus London	Rap	2011-07-19 00:00:00	The Guardian	61.0	Some songs sound like Fleetwood Mac, others could have fallen off the back of a Basement Jaxx album, while hints of David Guetta and Mark Ronson appear throughout.

'64 - '95	Lemon Jelly	Electronic	2005-01-25 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	72.0	So it essentially comes down to the fact that “Come Down on Me” and “Go” are likely going to be two of the best tracks of the year, but that a great deal of ’64-’95 is less likely to stick to memory.
Silence Is Wild	Frida Hyvonen	Rock	2008-11-04 00:00:00	AllMusic	78.0	Silence Is Wild is a solid step forward for Frida Hyvönen and a record to check out if you like singer/songwriters with a unique approach to be singing and songwriting.
Animal Feelings	Rafter	Indie	2010-04-13 00:00:00	AllMusic	69.0	Animal Feelings is still more sweet than sweaty, and may not get indie diehards to shake what their mamas gave them. Nevertheless, it more than delivers on the promise of Rafter's earlier music and fits right in with YACHT, Dan Deacon, Bobby Birdman, and the other acts fusing electronic, pop, R&B;, and indie pop elements into playful grooves.
The Distance Is So Big	Lemuria	Pop/Rock	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	74.0	Ozzella and Kerns match and meld more effectively than previous efforts.
An Other Cup	Yusuf	Rock	2006-11-14 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	65.0	The Cat is back, albeit more of a moonshadow of his former self and lacking some purr and bite.
Absolution	Muse	Rock	2004-03-23 00:00:00	DementedBySpace	72.0	Remember Showbiz... Who would've thought that a band who made a album so down to earth with it's alt rock could make something sound soRemember Showbiz... Who would've thought that a band who made a album so down to earth with it's alt rock could make something sound so extraterrestrial. Origin of symmetry just opened a gate for us, but as it ends we were disabled to enter, kind of like an ending to an episode of a show which continues to the beginning of the next one. So with absolution muse have not only continued their work they've previously set up on OoS but they added so much on it. Guitars are so heavy that they could recreate the effect of a Moses stick, the melodies are layered perfectly and the album itself is nothing short of a classic.  The grandiosity of muses music only adds to the curiosity of whether all those themes could be applied to the world we currently live in, that is, are those lyrics used as a metaphor describing our surroundings covering us so tight. Political songs like time is running out drain from the usual muse theme well of political corruption and brainwashing while other apocalypse invocating songs are doing their job too good that they make you question whether you can take muse seriously. Apocalypse please, an art rock song with a mind dementia inducing piano work that would postpone a true apocalypse until the songs end at least. But muse don't stop here, they make a ironic, even sarcastic, tribute to the underground society (let's call them underground) with ruled by secrecy, they question current beliefs in the unnatural (that is they question the perspective in which we see god and religion) with thoughts of a dying atheist and even pay attention to the human mind and thought and the way they provide as a muse for creating. All of these themes put together on a same record are a bit too much to take and digest, but once they lay down and insert themselves in your head you will be one lucky bastard (of course if you allow them to).  Bringing new philosophical foundations to life has never been so much fun, just remember to close that gate until the next release.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Heirlooms	Dave Aju	Electronic	2012-05-08 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	84.0	It seems like a humble accomplishment, but it is richly rewarding.
Space Is Only Noise	Nicolas Jaar	Electronic	2011-01-28 00:00:00	Pitchfork	86.0	This teetering restraint masks the true weirdness of Space Is Only Noise. I could understand someone finding the intensely self-contained Space a bit claustrophobic, but the album is most rewarding when you just grab a seat at the table.
Where The Wild Things Are [OST]	Karen O And The Kids	Indie	2009-09-29 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	77.0	This soundtrack is a successful exercise in painting pictures with music.
Waterloo To Anywhere	Dirty Pretty Things	Rock	2006-08-08 00:00:00	Blender	72.0	Barat lacks Doherty's flash of unhinged genius, but his grasp of rock's basics is far firmer. [Sep 2006, p.139]
Logos	Atlas Sound	Indie	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	81.0	Logos is a gorgeous, hallucinatory and somewhat sickly outing.
Ruby Red	The Love Language	Pop/Rock	2013-07-23 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	67.0	Ruby Red is free to sprawl and amble, joyous in its own sense of creative possibility.
Alvvays	Alvvays	Pop/Rock	2014-07-22 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	78.0	[A] great debut record laced with melancholy and beautiful moments.
Crystal Castles	Crystal Castles	Indie	2008-03-18 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	73.0	It is also, perhaps more importantly, an album absolutely overloaded with spine-tingling, pulse-quickening electro noises.
Actor	St. Vincent	Indie	2009-05-05 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	81.0	Like an unsettling dream, Actor will stay with you for quite a while, but it isn’t listeners or critics that will be discomfited by the eccentric sophistication here.
Make Believe	Weezer	Rock	2005-05-10 00:00:00	Q Magazine	52.0	Hints that Cuomo may be approaching some sort of personal epiphany about his place in the world. [Jun 2005, p.116]
There's Nothing Wrong with Me	Major League	Pop/Rock	2014-11-04 00:00:00	PopMatters	64.0	Major League is a volatile act with a subtle streak. If the lyrics can catch up to the tunes, the band will be tough to ignore.
To Willie	Phosphorescent	Indie	2009-02-03 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	78.0	Houck's voice knows exactly when to crack, and when the material's as great as this, that's the only embellishment you need.
Payback	Danny!	Rap	2012-09-25 00:00:00	RapReviews.com	76.0	There's a decade of depth to D. Swain that shows in every bar, note, and beat of this Payback, one which should hopefully give the music biz a big smack in the face.
Nights Out	Metronomy	Electronic	2008-09-08 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	70.0	While the record confirms the outfit as a fully-fledged trio, the vocal numbers bring Mount forward as a decent front man with the necessary charisma, and enough variety in his voice to bring decidedly varied results.
Working Man's Cafe	Ray Davies	Rock	2008-02-19 00:00:00	Mojo	75.0	Not every number here reaches its perfection, but 'twas ever thus with the works of Raymond Douglas Davies; warts and all, and even the warts are interesting. [Dec 2007, p.109]
Julia with Blue Jeans On	Moonface	Pop/Rock	2013-10-29 00:00:00	PopMatters	80.0	Julia is more touching than any Krug record made before it.
Fragrant World	Yeasayer	Pop/Rock	2012-08-21 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	71.0	The band's tendency to overreach may be muted on Fragrant World, but Yeasayer is still as earnestly silly as ever.
Kings & Queens	The National Trust	Indie	2006-01-24 00:00:00	Dot Music	60.0	"A smart, exuberant and very real record, whose reach has nothing to do with ""authenticity""."
LCD Soundsystem	LCD Soundsystem	Indie	2005-02-15 00:00:00	Urb	86.0	It's mostly about a rollicking anti-frat party, where grizzled indie kids take ecstasy and discover the primal appeal of the dance floor. [Mar 2005, p.112]
Floating Coffin	Thee Oh Sees	Pop/Rock	2013-04-16 00:00:00	No Ripcord	82.0	You can’t necessarily call this new music, but it works because it doesn’t sound vintage, nor does it completely owe itself to any bygone era of “remember when?”.
In a Warzone	Transplants	Pop/Rock	2013-06-25 00:00:00	Kerrang!	64.0	Perhaps more a flight of fancy than a labour of love, this is still a striking offering from the Transplants. [29 Jun 2013, p.54]
Beacons Of Ancestorship	Tortoise	Rock	2009-06-23 00:00:00	Mojo	71.0	The quintet's first bona fide album in five years, perhaps acknowledges the baton passing, as does an absence of post-rock tropes. [Jul 2009, p.97]
Closer to Closed	Braid	Pop/Rock	2011-08-16 00:00:00	Pitchfork	65.0	This year, we've seen Taking Back Sunday, Saves The Day, and the Get Up Kids attempting to play catch up with themselves, but here Braid bafflingly jettison the goodwill of their past: the palm-muted verses and squeaky choruses, the one-sided conversations of the lyrics, the antiseptic production -- I'll say it could come from anyone because you probably don't remember who the Pinehurst Kids are.
The Only She Chapters	Prefuse 73	Electronic	2011-04-26 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	68.0	The instrumentation-whether played, programmed, or sampled; a little of each typically goes into Prefuse 73's recordings-is given room to stretch its limbs. Sonically, a lot of wind seems to sweep.
Dr. No's Ethiopium	Oh No	Rap	2009-11-24 00:00:00	Urb	84.0	Ethiopium is an instant classic that reveals its true essence after every listen, and as such, will only reward those who prove worthy.
Shamelessly Exciting	Jason Forrest	Electronic	2005-10-11 00:00:00	Splendid	75.0	It's everything we've come to expect from Forrest in one gloriously hack 'n' sawed package, meticulously pieced together from his wide-ranging record collection.

Talkie Walkie	Air	Electronic	2004-01-27 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	75.0	Tighter songwriting and an undercurrent of dark claustrophobia distinguish the disc from its predecessors. [23/30 Jan 2004, p.99]
Push The Button	The Chemical Brothers	Electronic	2005-01-25 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	71.0	The problem with ‘Push The Button’ is that it’s all so predictable.
Home Acres	Aloha	Indie	2010-03-09 00:00:00	Spin	74.0	Pretty much every song on this prog-pop band's sixth disc evokes moodiness via some sort of weather, event, or technological-flux metaphor. It's a suitable theme for elegantly mutable yet hummably compact songs, led by marimba as often as guitar.

Hobo Rocket	Pond	Pop/Rock	2013-08-06 00:00:00	The Quietus	71.0	This more lithe and economical album in many ways proves that Pond have taken a further step towards genuine maturity, but it does still seem rather thrown together and the result of a scattergun approach to both composition and arrangements.
Wooden Aquarium	Mazes	Pop/Rock	2014-09-08 00:00:00	AllMusic	77.0	A really strong album that shows Mazes growing in just the right way, adding some maturity and substance without sacrificing the things (great songs, youthful energy) that made them worth hearing in the first place.
Lost Channels	Great Lake Swimmers	Indie	2009-03-31 00:00:00	Lost At Sea	73.0	Lost Channels is still comforting, except now instead of misery finding company, Great Lake Swimmers have made an album that reaches down, and pulls you out of the darkness and into the light that was always there.
Wilco (The Album)	Wilco	Rock	2009-06-30 00:00:00	j30	76.0	The album feels uneven, you have some really good songs and some mediocre songs. Wilco (The Song) and Bull Black Nova are two key tracks that I love.

My recommendation is to focus on the songwriting instead of the ""this-song-just-sounds-like-the-one-before-feeling"".

Man-Made	Teenage Fanclub	Indie	2005-06-07 00:00:00	Neumu.net	79.0	You could dismiss Teenage Fanclub as not being original, but that would be missing the point. Instead, appreciate a group that, in 2005, can create absolutely perfect songs that somehow manage to channel the magic of early-to-mid-'60s pop-rock.
American Slang	The Gaslight Anthem	Rock	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Clash Music	80.0	It's less immediate than previous material, but nevertheless absorbs the magic of the world, distilling it into ten slices of trembling, impassioned rock 'n' roll.
Accelerate	R.E.M.	Rock	2008-04-01 00:00:00	Billboard	79.0	Accelerate may not stun on impact like some R.E.M. records, but it's still habit-forming.
I Feel Cream	Peaches	Rock	2009-05-05 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	74.0	"Okay, maybe age has softened Peaches a tad, but if I Feel Cream is the result, it sounds more compelling and radical than any number of new iterations of ""sucking on my titties."""

Liquid Swords [The Chess Box]	Genius / GZA	Pop/Rock	2012-07-24 00:00:00	RapReviews.com	94.0	It's a historical artifact on an otherwise up-to-date album, one which is more important now that hip-hop needs a refresher on the essence of skills and the value of balancing the materialistic with the intellectual.
Green Language	Rustie	Electronic	2014-08-26 00:00:00	Fact Magazine (UK)	67.0	Up and down we go, and each time the adrenaline rush lessens.
All the Women I Am	Reba McEntire	Country	2010-11-09 00:00:00	Boston Globe	74.0	This is her 34th studio disc and one of her best efforts. It blends hard-edged, modern country-rock with some profoundly tender ballad singing
Silver Bell	Patty Griffin	Folk	2013-10-08 00:00:00	Record Collector	83.0	Produced by Daniel Lanois and newly mixed by Glyn Johns, there’s a more soulful side to Griffin on the shuffling lament Sooner Or Later, while One More Girl veers towards the folky introspection of early Joni Mitchell.
Father, Son, Holy Ghost	Girls	Pop/Rock	2011-09-13 00:00:00	Pitchfork	79.0	This lyrical simplicity shouldn't obscure the fact that these are sharply constructed songs that take unusual turns. One of Girls' specialities is their willingness to go completely over the top but somehow keep us right there with them.

The Manticore and Other Horrors	Cradle of Filth	Pop/Rock	2012-10-30 00:00:00	PopMatters	70.0	The Manticore and Other Horrors is a scathing return to form that gives the band its credibility back, and certifies that Cradle of Filth deserve to be classed as a British extreme metal institution.
Green Lanes	Ultimate Painting	Pop/Rock	2015-08-07 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	70.0	Once you’ve finished playing Name That Influence, it becomes just a nice mid-tempo indie pop record with catchy guitar hooks.
Minotaur	The Clientele	Pop/Rock	2010-08-31 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	73.0	"Though a newcomer to The Clientele should not start here, it's strong throughout, with the exception of the aberrant (if mild) guitar freakout in ""Jerry"" and a creepy piano solo, ""No. 33,"" which, if unobjectionable, seems unnecessary."

New Again	Taking Back Sunday	Rock	2009-06-02 00:00:00	OneSamTwoCups	77.0	"Often considered as the album that killed Taking Back Sunday, is the most underrated album under the band's belt. The previous release,Often considered as the album that killed Taking Back Sunday, is the most underrated album under the band's belt. The previous release, ""Louder Now"", was a strong but weak at times effort to follow up on a great album (""Where You Want To Be""). If I could've had it my way, this should've been the album that followed it up. ""New Again"" shows sorrow and pain in the largest of things, whether it be God or relationships, and nails it. Tracks like ""New Again"", ""Swing"", or ""Carpathia"" show a deeper side to Lazzara's writing more than ""Louder Now"" ever did. The standout track on this album is definitely ""Everything Must Go"", building up to a Appleseed Cast-esq post rock epic chorus in spite of divorce. ""New Again"" definitely doesn't get a lot of time in the spotlight enough, considering it may be one of the best Taking Back Sunday albums to date.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"

Epic	Sharon Van Etten	Pop/Rock	2010-09-21 00:00:00	The New York Times	82.0	Like Jenn Wasner of Wye Oak or her fellow Brooklynite Holly Miranda, Ms. Van Etten has an incandescent, moaning alto that can be fragile or vengeful.

Wild Young Hearts	Noisettes	Indie	2009-09-22 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	74.0	Leaving behind the soul-infused, gutter-punk leanings of their debut, this desperately craves the attentions of the MOR indie mainstream in a way so steeped in bathos that the over-produced sheen of the car-ad soundtracking title track shines less like superstar diamonds and more like sun off a bald man’s head.

Born Again In The USA	Loose Fur	Indie	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	72.0	What ultimately makes the album something of a chore is its one-joke premise, a preaching-to-the-choir broadside against the Evangelical right's ongoing assault on individual liberties and rational thought.
The New Game	Mudvayne	Rock	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Boston Globe	50.0	Mudvayne used to be viewed as somewhat of a joke band with its costumes and makeup, but they're more out front and naked now, with markedly more genuine results.
Whiskey Tango Ghosts	Tanya Donelly	Indie	2004-07-27 00:00:00	PopMatters	72.0	The plaintive mood of this album is a slow burn, seeping into the listener's consciousness over time, not revealing itself suddenly, but rather releasing its dandelion of pop dander into the wind in a measured but carefree manner.

The Last DJ	Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers	Rock	2002-10-08 00:00:00	AllMusic	61.0	Throughout The Last DJ, Petty sounds utterly lost -- and instead of liberating him like it did in the past, it paralyzes him, boxing him into a corner where he can't draw on his strengths. It's the first true flop in a career that, until now, had none.
1977	Terius Nash	Rap	2011-08-31 00:00:00	The New York Times	66.0	These songs aren't much more than melodic rants, but that's enough for Mr. Nash, who's never been a forceful singer, but whose talent for cramming oddball twists into R&B; remains unparalleled.
Levon Vincent	Levon Vincent	Electronic	2015-02-10 00:00:00	Pitchfork	85.0	Thanks to its pared-down gear list and capricious flow, Levon Vincent feels like the work of someone left alone in the studio, sketching in real time with what's at hand and moving on. And that spontaneity gives it an even greater sense of intimacy.
Lip Lock	Eve	Rap	2013-05-14 00:00:00	Fact Magazine (UK)	62.0	Lip Lock is exactly the kind of pop album that rappers set on crossover success should be making.
Only Run	Clap Your Hands Say Yeah	Pop/Rock	2014-06-03 00:00:00	American Songwriter	64.0	If Only Run proves anything, it’s that Clap Your Hands Say Yeah are still making music on their own terms--they just have the budget and freedom to pull it off with a little more flash.
Weapons Of Mass Destruction	Xzibit	Rap	2004-12-14 00:00:00	Dot Music	57.0	Ethical incontinence notwithstanding, Xzibit is an undeniably charismatic vocalist, with a gift for pure, jolting, testosterone-packed aggression that leads to some rather magnificent moments.
Dreaming Of Revenge	Kaki King	Indie	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	72.0	While not all of King’s attempts to focus her talent into ‘proper songs’ come off, when she nails it, we can’t help but agree with Dave Grohl that she’s one of the greatest guitarists in the world.
At.Long.Last.A$AP	A$AP Rocky	Rap	2015-05-26 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	76.0	At.Long.Last.A$AP takes the gritty East Coast classicism and syrup-drippin' Houston screwiness of his killer 2013 debut, Long.Live.A$AP, and adds an extra level of psychedelic sprawl via a newfound taste for acid.
Redeemer of Souls	Judas Priest	Pop/Rock	2014-07-08 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	74.0	Redeemer is proof that Priest can still call themselves metal's defenders of the faith.
The Lonely Position of Neutral	Trust Company	Rock	2002-07-23 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	59.0	The singing's understatement and harmonic sophistication help the band transcend overblown corporate rock and embrace sensitive emo pop.
Talk That Talk	Rihanna	Pop	2011-11-21 00:00:00	The New York Times	64.0	Rihanna's version of this sound [dance music] dates to the club music of the early 1990s, an era in which she would have shined. The best songs on this lively and often great album sound synth-perfect for that time.
Human After All	Daft Punk	Electronic	2005-03-15 00:00:00	No Ripcord	57.0	Inexplicably, predictably, Daft Punk have become the first band to produce a retro post-parody of their own work.

Lost in Alphaville	The Rentals	Pop/Rock	2014-08-26 00:00:00	AllMusic	69.0	"Certainly more mature and thoughtful, with no ""Friends of P"" in sight, but plenty of songs that sound like timeless hits, and plenty of powerfully felt and delivered songs that hit hard right in the nostalgia zone, drawing blood and tears with every blow."
Tundra	Lakker	Electronic	2015-05-11 00:00:00	Mixmag	75.0	The operatic IDM of the previously released 'Mountain Divide' is hard not to view as the pick, but even so, Tundra still has all the sonic intensity of an R&S; classic.
Boys Outside	Steve Mason	Indie	2010-06-22 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	80.0	He's turned a hard patch into something transcendental. However brief, however ephemeral, there's a sense of spiritual overcoming that encompasses not just his own history, but the experiences that listeners bring to these sad songs, as well.
SBTRKT	SBTRKT	Electronic	2011-06-28 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	76.0	SBTRKT (real name unknown) tries a lot of things on his debut-and succeeds at most.

Way To Normal	Ben Folds	Rock	2008-09-30 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	62.0	Folds has a gift for melody--nearly every song comes with a memorable hook--but his imagination as an arranger remains limited.
Trilogy	The Weeknd	R&B;	2012-11-13 00:00:00	The Boston Phoenix	79.0	Even at Tesfaye's most awkward, it's impossible not to be intoxicated.
The Sound Of The Smiths	The Smiths	Indie	2008-11-11 00:00:00	Uncut	88.0	If nothing can quite replicate the excitement of hearing these songs for the first time, the first disc of this double-CD set makes a good job of restating the importance of The Smiths as a singles band.
Trilogy	The Weeknd	R&B;	2012-11-13 00:00:00	Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM)	79.0	This kind of remaster campaign is normally reserved for albums that have had decades to sink into the national consciousness as is, introducing a shock-of-the-new, hearing-it-again-for-the-first-time element, and while the oldest of the Trilogy material has only been around for a year and a half or so, the differences in the new mixes can still be jarring.
Last of Our Kind	The Darkness	Pop/Rock	2015-06-02 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	63.0	Their fourth, Last Of Our Kind, includes some formulaic hard rock, Cheap Trick and Starship apery and flat-out misses. But it has its moments, to be sure.
Whales and Leeches	Red Fang	Pop/Rock	2013-10-15 00:00:00	Pitchfork	71.0	Red Fang certainly sounds good on Whales and Leeches, with the production of the Decemberists multi-instrumentalist Chris Funk again giving their instruments ample breadth and weight. But they do not match that surface with substance.
Kaleide	Sky Larkin	Rock	2010-08-10 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	69.0	"Kaleide is immediate and it rarely dulls, bar the slow start to ""Anjelica Huston,"" before it bursts out into sparkling keyboards at the tail end."

The Guest	Phantom Planet	Indie	2002-02-26 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	71.0	A gem, with sunny three-part harmonies and songs that sound familiar in the best way.
Sumday	Grandaddy	Indie	2003-06-10 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	78.0	While the melodies have grown catchier and the arrangements more focused, [Jason] Lytle has leapt into the lyrical big leagues with unassuming songs about entropy and epiphany.
Worship the Sun	Allah-Las	Pop/Rock	2014-09-16 00:00:00	The Observer (UK)	72.0	There is a point where the vocals (all four Las sing) stop being retro nasal tributes and start sounding a little thin.
Tender is the Night	Old Man Luedecke	Folk	2012-11-13 00:00:00	PopMatters	70.0	Tender Is the Night is a mostly great album that succeeds in being a crowd pleaser as opposed to a serious work of art.
Saltash Bells	John Surman	Jazz	2012-06-26 00:00:00	The Independent on Sunday (UK)	84.0	"While there's perhaps a surfeit of synth-washes, the beautiful ""Winter Elegy"" superbly fulfils the opening promise."
Cake & Pie	Lisa Loeb	Rock	2002-02-26 00:00:00	E! Online	64.0	She fails to bake any new ideas, leaving us with the same old sad love songs and confused-girl anthems that the Texas torchbearer has always churned out.

Wrecking Ball	Bruce Springsteen	Pop/Rock	2012-03-06 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	78.0	If that presentation doesn't always hit the mark, the sentiment behind it often does, and the album never completely derails.
Rings Around The World	Super Furry Animals	Indie	2002-03-19 00:00:00	Nude As The News	86.0	Rings Around The World takes another twelve bold strides forward, applying the technology explored on earlier efforts like Radiator and Guerrilla and the restraint exercised on the more lo-fi Mwng to a fresh set of songs that stretch the group's stylistic boundaries and provide the young century with one of its first classic albums.
Chilltown New York	Erick Sermon	Rap	2004-06-22 00:00:00	PopMatters	74.0	As strong as anything Sermon's done.
We Are Born	Sia	Pop	2010-06-22 00:00:00	Boston Globe	68.0	"While the music isn't out of step with what we've come to expect from American pop stars, the difference is Sia's songs here sound downright lived through: See the fragile cover of Madonna's ""Oh Father'' for reference."
Caught In The Trees	Damien Jurado	Indie	2008-09-09 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	75.0	What Jurado does most isn't necessarily what he does best, which is what makes the first half of Caught In The Trees so refreshing.
Endlessly	Duffy	R&B;	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Chicago Tribune	59.0	Duffy's pinched voice warbles into Lulu land pretty frequently, and that squeakiness isn't helped much by the music: five ballads swathed in strings and heartache, five uptempo tracks with a bit more bounce but not much attitude.
Lustre	Ed Harcourt	Rock	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Pitchfork	76.0	When it isn't a high school poetry recital, Lustre often feels like a disappearing act-- an attempt to put on a few musical disguises to see if anyone likes them better than the musician beneath.
Do To the Beast	The Afghan Whigs	Pop/Rock	2014-04-15 00:00:00	Q Magazine	74.0	At times it's almost too much to take in, the album's secrets and flavours gradually revealing themselves on the third or fourth listen. [May 2014, p.112]

The Search	Son Volt	Rock	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Amazon.com	65.0	While it may be impossible for this Son Volt to ever reach the pinnacle of their 1995 debut, no one can accuse Jay Farrar of going through the motions.
Avril Lavigne	Avril Lavigne	Pop/Rock	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Billboard.com	65.0	For the most part, Lavigne's fifth full-length encapsulates everything worth loving about the 29-year-old's long-running artistry.
Chromatics	Diagrams	Pop/Rock	2015-01-19 00:00:00	No Ripcord	73.0	It’s largely inoffensive and bland, with a few above average moments, and has a tendency to fade into the background.
Mad Love	Cheval Sombre	Pop/Rock	2012-10-29 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	70.0	Definitely a beautiful album but its hopelessness is never-ending, like a friend telling you their relationship troubles for hours and hours.
The Name Of This Band Is Talking Heads [2004 Version]	Talking Heads	Rock	2004-08-17 00:00:00	AllMusic	93.0	The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads is not only a vital document of an important, groundbreaking band on their way up, it's one of their best albums, easily surpassing Stop Making Sense.
Come With Us	The Chemical Brothers	Dance	2002-01-29 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	72.0	Tally this time: two heady club anthems, two B-side-ish vocal numbers, and lotsa bonus beats.
The Silence	Silence	Pop/Rock	2015-03-24 00:00:00	AllMusic	82.0	Throughout, The Silence doesn't rush, it slowly emerges; it doesn't bludgeon the listener with cluttered instrumentation or sonics, but it is seductively heavy due to spaciousness in the mix, warmth, and colorful imaginative textures.
The Drop	Pinkunoizu	Pop/Rock	2013-08-05 00:00:00	DIY Magazine	76.0	A promising album that should make the next journey with them all the more exciting.
In a Dream	The Juan MacLean	Electronic	2014-09-16 00:00:00	Magnet	77.0	The longer cuts here have some great ones. It's just the kind the Juan MacLean crafts seem to work best with plenty of room to wriggle and stretch. [No. 113, p.57]
Makes a King	The Very Best	Pop/Rock	2015-04-07 00:00:00	Uncut	78.0	Recording in an African village with a laptop and local musicians lends a more organic feel than previous releases. [May 2015, 84]
Purple Naked Ladies	The Internet	Rap	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Pitchfork	55.0	Like many spinoffs from the Odd Future machine, it's a small piece of a larger puzzle, useful for obsessives concerned with keeping their catalogs up to date.
The North	Stars	Alternative/Indie Rock	2012-09-04 00:00:00	AllMusic	70.0	What is easy to figure out is that they are still operating at top capacity and anyone looking for smart, emotional pop that sounds almost perfect can turn to Stars for all their needs.

Kings & Queens	Jamie T	Indie	2009-10-06 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	74.0	This album is a stylized, slightly-paranoid romp sure to pluck the heartstrings of anyone who has ever lived life with reckless abandon.
We The Best Forever	DJ Khaled	Rap	2011-07-19 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	61.0	The Miami radio DJ and Terror Squad member takes few stylistic chances, making We The Best Forever a mostly tedious listen despite its flashes of lyrical invention.
Big Bad World	Plain White T's	Rock	2008-09-23 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	47.0	This time around, it's all saccharine pop and desperate ballads.
Back To The Web	Elf Power	Indie	2006-04-25 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	67.0	It's hard to figure out what exactly the concept is behind this concept album.
Rebel Heart	Madonna	Pop/Rock	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Q Magazine	68.0	Rebel Heart often strikes a more tentative note.[Apr 2015, p.100]
Backspacer	Pearl Jam	Rock	2009-09-20 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	79.0	A little more effort at the end would have been appreciated, but so long as you’re content with paying full price for what’s essentially twenty-eight minutes of listenable music, Backspacer works as a fun little rock n’roll record.
Cosy Moments	Kinski	Pop/Rock	2013-04-02 00:00:00	PopMatters	59.0	The first half of Cosy Moments may pale placed next to Alpine Static, but for those who may be put off by that album’s sprawl and punch, Cosy Moments prolongs the slightly gentler, less fuzzy nature of this restless sonic beast.
Blood for the Master	Goatwhore	Pop/Rock	2012-02-14 00:00:00	PopMatters	61.0	Blood for the Master represents Goatwhore reverting back to their less-than-great death/thrash sonic territory, which is good for a quick listen, but not much more.
I Am Not Afraid Of You And I Will Beat Your Ass	Yo La Tengo	Indie	2006-09-12 00:00:00	Magnet	85.0	This return to form annotates the band's last 22 years rather nicely. [#73, p.110]

Sea Of Cowards	The Dead Weather	Rock	2010-05-11 00:00:00	PopMatters	70.0	On Sea of Cowards, they’ve made an album that manages to sound like they give a damn about not giving a damn, and one that’s pretty compelling, more often than not.
Beauty & Ruin	Bob Mould	Pop/Rock	2014-06-03 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	76.0	On Beauty & Ruin, second chances aren’t taken for granted--they’re embraced with unfettered ferocity and humble grace.

Paul Walker	Drug Church	Pop/Rock	2013-07-23 00:00:00	Punknews.org (Staff)	75.0	Paul Walker is painfully realistic, openly grim and socially unconscious, expressing a worldview that really, only Kindlon seems comfortable expressing in our scene.

Surfing the Void	Klaxons	Pop/Rock	2010-08-23 00:00:00	Sputnikmusic	68.0	In defence of Surfing the Void, it's certainly not an album I'd describe as 'bad' per se--it's just a massive disappointment.

Steam Days	Nathan Fake	Electronic	2012-08-27 00:00:00	The Observer (UK)	67.0	Midway through Steam Days, Harnser does dark pizzicato things befitting a 90s warehouse rave, while elsewhere, the analogue-melting-into-digital influence of Four Tet is palpable.
Set Free	American Analog Set	Indie	2005-09-20 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	72.0	For existing fans, they'll either be happy to hear another assured rehash of the band's classic sound, or disappointed that it's just a rehash.

Bending the Dark	The Imagined Village	Folk	2012-05-14 00:00:00	Q Magazine	69.0	Things often get a bit messy, the meandering 12-minute title track with its extended percussion battle being the most jarring example. [Jun 2012, p.104]
Sirens of the Ditch	Jason Isbell	Rock	2007-07-10 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	78.0	Isbell shines most when he’s not channeling; tracks like 'Chicago Promenade,' 'Shotgun Wedding' and tasteful protest ballad 'Dress Blues' (which smartly chooses empathy over proselytizing) find his sound evolving into an alternately rocked-up and quietly satisfying maturity.
TP.3 Reloaded	R. Kelly	Pop	2005-07-05 00:00:00	BreeT	60.0	Its an awsome album, R.Kelly is still the best, n&#039; he&#039;s real, Love U R.

The  Power Within	DragonForce	Pop/Rock	2012-04-17 00:00:00	AlexxTrusc	74.0	"DragonForce has gained huge popularity mainly through the Guitar Hero game series - where they had lent one of their songs: ""Through The FireDragonForce has gained huge popularity mainly through the Guitar Hero game series - where they had lent one of their songs: ""Through The Fire And Flames"" which thus became the hit number of the British band. The latest album ""The Power Within"" is the fifth and probably the best release, in which the band still regales listeners with a very decent dose of power metal - as seen for example in ""Holding On"" or ""Last Man Stands"". However, the greatest advantage and yet change is certainly the presence of a new singer - Mark Hudson, who has a much better vocal range.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"

You Could Have It So Much Better	Franz Ferdinand	Indie	2005-10-04 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	83.0	The album is just as solid as Franz Ferdinand’s 2004 eponymous debut, and it shows that the group clearly knows its sound -- maybe a little too well.
Transparent Things	Fujiya & Miyagi	Indie	2007-01-23 00:00:00	Spin	79.0	This is dance music downsized for iPods but also indie rock expanded for the dance floor. [Jan 2007, p.89]
New Blood	Peter Gabriel	Pop/Rock	2011-10-11 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	70.0	Sure, the albums is filled with grand, sweeping sonic statements, but they seem to come from a place in extremely close proximity to the art-rock icon's heart. That's why it works.
Veckatimest	Grizzly Bear	Indie	2009-05-26 00:00:00	Lost At Sea	85.0	While Veckatimest contains just over fifty-two minutes of some exceptional music, it lacks one critical component that's essential to any form of art: emotion.
Ones and Sixes	Low	Pop/Rock	2015-09-11 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	78.0	It is arguable that Ones And Sixes is their most fully integrated album to date--a richly satisfying and coherent work drawing together many of the different strands of their career so far.

Forever	Painted Palms	Pop/Rock	2014-01-14 00:00:00	Uncut	65.0	They might've allowed the collage more space to breathe, for the bandwidth is densely layered to bursting with blissed-out sampling; but the rapture makes it churlish to complain. [Feb 2014, p.80]
L.A.X.	The Game	Rap	2008-08-26 00:00:00	Urb	65.0	The Game pairs that unabashed love with swirling ideas and concepts that elevate the record to an easy contender for album of the year.

Twins	Ty Segall	Pop/Rock	2012-10-09 00:00:00	CMJ	80.0	The album, however, cannot shake off the feeling that it's a melting pot of Segall's previous albums from this year.
Settle	Disclosure	Electronic	2013-06-04 00:00:00	CMJ	81.0	Nothing on Settle is left wanting. Disclosure’s debut full-length, after a series of tight and well-curated EPs, has high points as high as any record this year.
Himalayan	Band of Skulls	Pop/Rock	2014-04-01 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	70.0	They’ve certainly aimed for the mountaintops with Himalayan and quite often they reach the summit.
Nervous	Siskiyou	Pop/Rock	2015-01-20 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	78.0	Much of Nervous is a little heavy for what is, on the surface at least, a gentle, lilting folk inflected album. However, there are moments of utter joyfulness to be found.
New Amerykah Part Two: Return of the Ankh	Erykah Badu	R&B;	2010-03-30 00:00:00	No Ripcord	83.0	This isn’t political, but it is personal, comical, sad, satirical, intelligent and refreshingly honest.
Year Zero	Nine Inch Nails	Rock	2007-04-17 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	76.0	Reznor seems to eschew depth for surface explosions and instant gratification, and the result is a finished product that, while decent on an individual track, doesn't hold up as Year Zero progresses.
Let There Be Morning	The Perishers	Indie	2005-04-12 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	65.0	A lovely twilight trip. [15 Apr 2005, p.77]
Pyramids	Pyramids	Rock	2008-04-22 00:00:00	PopMatters	69.0	Pyramids’ very impressive debut treads the fine line between otherworldly beauty and sheer unadulterated noise, its loveliest soundscapes blotted by feedback and distortion, its most aggressively ugly rampages pierced by unexpected intervals of tranquility.
Battle Studies	John Mayer	Rock	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Hartford Courant	64.0	His vocals here are mostly murmurs, and the musical accompaniment, though skillful throughout, lacks the punch of his previous albums.

Advance Base Battery Life	Casiotone For The Painfully Alone	Indie	2009-03-10 00:00:00	Under The Radar	71.0	Advance Base Battery Life finds all the signature CFTPA attributes in display with the usual blankets of ambient electronics, tinny drum machines, a few synthetic strings, and Ashworth's genius monotone lyrical narratives about breakups, laundry mats, and just about every other mudane subject only Ashworth can make interesting. [Spring 2009, p.70]
Sticks + Stones	Cher Lloyd	Pop/Rock	2012-10-02 00:00:00	AllMusic	51.0	There are times throughout its ten tracks when Lloyd does appear to be testing the patience of even her most ardent fans.
Made in California [Box Set]	The Beach Boys	Pop	2013-08-27 00:00:00	Uncut	86.0	"Some of their most startling material has always been found down the back of the sofa, among such relatively unconsidered trifles as ""In The Back Of My Mind"" and ""Angel Come Home."" [Oct 2013, p.82]"

She Has No Strings Apollo	Dirty Three	Indie	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Splendid	79.0	She Has No Strings Apollo is, if anything, a portrait of one of the most passionate bands you'll ever hear, at a time when they've fine-tuned their improvisational telepathy.
Son Of Evil Reindeer	The Reindeer Section	Indie	2002-08-13 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	71.0	Most of the collaborators turn up only as backup vocalists or orchestra members, enabling Lightbody's heartbreaking ballads and sublime baritone to soar.
Back On My B.S.	Busta Rhymes	Rap	2009-05-19 00:00:00	Mojo	60.0	"His sometimes unkempt vocal performances can work better in the smaller doses of singles or cameos, but here, as on 2006's ""The Big Bang,"" he sounds like he has made the album his metier. [Jul 2009, p.98]"
Reanimation	Linkin Park	Rock	2002-07-30 00:00:00	Blender	60.0	Linkin gain from their hip-hop daring, and the dance domos get to wedge a foot in the crossover door. [#9, p.151]

Nothing's Gonna Change the Way You Feel About Me Now	Justin Townes Earle	Pop/Rock	2012-03-26 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	72.0	It's a watered-down Earle, perhaps more than we'd expect, but it works.
Together	The New Pornographers	Rock	2010-05-04 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	71.0	Together is certainly far-reaching in its ambitions, and it often seems close to collapsing under the combined weight of all its collaborators, but it never falters, despite its dangerous dance. The New Pornographers have taken a risk in fussing with their sound, but in large part it's paid off beautifully.
Alpinisms	School of Seven Bells	Rock	2008-10-28 00:00:00	Spin	70.0	Alpinisms' sweeping, ethereal pop owes a stylistic debt to My Bloody Valentine and the Cocteau Twins, but the debut album by former Secret Machines guitarist Ben Curtis' new project reveals a range of influences and a sophisticated approach to arrangement that sets the trio well apart from less imaginative latter-day shoegazers.
Sunny Border Blue	Kristin Hersh	Indie	2001-03-06 00:00:00	Sonicnet	81.0	It contains some of the most affecting work she's ever created, exploring the power of songs stripped to their essence, and the juxtaposition of delicate melodies with the explosive emotions conveyed by her lyrics.
Within and Without	Washed Out	Pop/Rock	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Pitchfork	70.0	Within and Without is an excellent demonstration of what happens when, even after the buzz-band cycle has faded, you continue to investigate a sound on your own hushed, ambitious terms.
Days	Real Estate	Pop/Rock	2011-10-18 00:00:00	Pitchfork	77.0	Real Estate have such a knack for classic-sounding melody that every song quickly engages on a musical gut level.
Lust Lust Lust	The Raveonettes	Rock	2008-02-19 00:00:00	LiquidHeaven	72.0	Perhaps too early to say for certain but after a month with it I&#039;d call this their best album. It is certainly their most accomplished.
Diploid Love	Brody Dalle	Pop/Rock	2014-04-29 00:00:00	The Line of Best Fit	72.0	Dalle sounds as if she’s on autopilot for much of Diploid Love; she’s obviously got talent to spare, but she’ll need to provide herself with a sterner challenge than she has here if she’s to truly capitalise on it.
Songs For Christmas	Sufjan Stevens	Indie	2006-11-21 00:00:00	Q Magazine	80.0	The good news is Songs For Christmas isn't the self-indulgent folly it may appear. [Jan 2007, p.152]
Cope	Manchester Orchestra	Pop/Rock	2014-04-01 00:00:00	v208	70.0	"If you are looking for an album to blast while working out or preparing to battle to the death then this is the album for you. Atlanta rockersIf you are looking for an album to blast while working out or preparing to battle to the death then this is the album for you. Atlanta rockers Manchester Orchestra return with their 4th full length album and there is no surprise here, it is awesome.Layered guitar tracks smash through every track with unquestionable authority while Andy Hull's voice/beard leads the charge with never ending vigor. This album may lack the soft and desperately pleading melodies from Virgin, the complexity and personal depth of METN, and the hauntingly beautiful crescendo of children's choruses and orchestral string sections of Simple Math....but it makes up for all of that by melting your **** face off. Is it the same album as previous full length records? Absolutely not, and why would you want the same record again. Cope is not a creative flowering of a band maturing... It is a straightforwaed, wild, and unrelenting statement of ""we do whatever we want"".Make no mistake, Manchester Orchestra is fully capable of bringing the strengths and successes of the other albums back in full force whenever they so choose- the beauty of recording on your own label is that nobody forces you to make that ""next album"" a certain way.Cope has no master, certainly not the likes of you.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"

Who Kill	tUnE-yArDs	Pop/Rock	2011-04-19 00:00:00	Under The Radar	86.0	It's truly peerless music. And though Garbus sometimes teeters on the brink of musical bombast, her imagination propels it all forward while avoiding the quicksand of self-indulgence.
Jacksonville City Nights	Ryan Adams	Indie	2005-09-27 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	72.0	There’s a lot of filler here, even for Ryan.

Business Casual	Chromeo	Electronic	2010-09-14 00:00:00	The Boston Phoenix	68.0	Their signature '80s homage is consistent across their songwriting, lyrics, album covers, and design - even their videos. And despite their claims to the contrary, the duo have enough self-aware irony to rise above the level of a throwback novelty act or a one-trick nostalgia pony.
Rendezvous	Luna	Indie	2004-10-26 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	74.0	A relaxed, tender record with enough grace, humor, and intelligence mixed at just the right moments with heady rushes of musical energy that one is left captivated.

Mechanical Bull	Kings of Leon	Pop/Rock	2013-09-24 00:00:00	Filter	70.0	Though they may have felt immense pressure to replicate the monster hits that have come to be expected of them, the band have struck proper middle ground between the jaggedy, bluesy Southern rock of their early years with more polished commercial anthems.
Before Today	Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti	Indie	2010-06-08 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	85.0	Before Today accomplishes exactly the same thing all his other good records do, so I’m not sure it does much for me that, say, House Arrest didn’t. Nonetheless, it’s still one of his better records--there are some excellent pop songs here, and it’s a good place to start for listeners who are unfamiliar with Pink’s bizarre schtick.
Owl Splinters	Deaf Center	Electronic	2011-02-14 00:00:00	PopMatters	74.0	Owl Splinters has the veiled optimism of an overcast sky with just enough clear areas to allow rays of sun to shine through; it brings the duo's cacophonous fusion of horror and romance to its most fully realized incarnation yet.
Enemy/Lover	Dreamers of the Ghetto	Pop/Rock	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Blurt Magazine	63.0	This may be as good as it gets for Dreamers of the Ghetto, and it's really just fair.

Live!	Luna	Rock	2001-02-06 00:00:00	Splendid	75.0	Wine drinkers' music, you might say -- likeable, pleasant, but lacking in consuming, driving passion.
Limbo	Eric Copeland	Pop/Rock	2012-07-24 00:00:00	Pitchfork	82.0	It's best to turn off those imaginary filters when you pump Limbo, and just let it be as entertaining as it clearly wants to be.
Finding Forever	Common	Rap	2007-07-31 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	73.0	The album is both lush and gritty, integrating awkwardly hacked samples, rowdy percussion, and sweet backing vocals. [03 Aug 2007, p.67]

Tape Deck Heart	Frank Turner	Pop/Rock	2013-04-23 00:00:00	Punknews.org (Staff)	76.0	"Unfortunately, Tape Deck Heart is not his strongest offering as a whole, but it features a number of fantastic tracks that could conceivably be ""hits"" and will surely become live staples."

Weirdon	Purling Hiss	Pop/Rock	2014-09-23 00:00:00	CMJ	76.0	Weirdon is stacked with some hefty singles guaranteed to bring this band to an even wider audience, and it succeeds because it ups the ante in terms of songcraft and production, but never at the cost of the weirdness.

Cancer4Cure	El-P	Rap	2012-05-22 00:00:00	AllMusic	84.0	Cancer4Cure is about hip-hop like Glengarry Glen Ross was about sales, but these great works transcend their industries, offering solace and inspiration to anyone who would prefer a satisfied mind over a Cadillac Eldorado, or in current terms, an Escalade.

Once Again	John Legend	R&B;	2006-10-24 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	77.0	Like its predecessor, Once Again's midsection bulges with excess MOR fat, but unlike Legend's debut, the album doesn't resurrect itself by the end.
Strange Dreams	Alex Calder	Pop/Rock	2015-01-19 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	67.0	At times his vocals sound too distant in the mix and overpowered by guitars (No Device), but singing any more forcefully would undermine the peculiar comfort that most of the record maintains.
Reanimation	Linkin Park	Rock	2002-07-30 00:00:00	CDNow	60.0	As on Hybrid Theory, there's a definite formula at work in all 19 songs, but it's flawless and effective.
Silver & Gold [Boxset]	Sufjan Stevens	Folk	2012-11-13 00:00:00	The Guardian	76.0	So much, in other words, that wading through it feels as much of a chore as a joy.

In A Cave	Elf Power	Indie	2008-03-25 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	65.0	The production is sublime, every beat and note fully realised in glorious colour. The songs, however, sound tired, and despite determined efforts to sound upbeat and jaunty, they end in a slump of indie-pop lethargy.
Start Something	Lostprophets	Rock	2004-02-03 00:00:00	Splendid	70.0	This is one of the breeziest, catchiest discs I've heard in a while.
The Hawk Is Howling	Mogwai	Rock	2008-09-23 00:00:00	Village Voice	76.0	It's a page out of Mogwai grandchildren Ratatat's playbook, and it shows these Scots doing something we haven't seen them do in a while: evolve.

Centralia	Mountains	Electronic	2013-01-22 00:00:00	AllMusic	83.0	Much like the best of Eno's ambient work, Centralia is captivating without demanding attention, instead letting the listener wander into its web on their own.
Repave	Volcano Choir	Pop/Rock	2013-09-03 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	77.0	It's an abstract and occasionally disjointed album that ultimately finds a rewarding balance, both sonically and lyrically, between the obscure and the deeply personal.
West	Lucinda Williams	Rock	2007-02-13 00:00:00	Hot Press	69.0	West works because it juxtaposes a sense of vulnerability with a desire not to stay down for long, and is tinged with a sense of realism not always present in her rivals.

Living Fields	Portico	Electronic	2015-04-07 00:00:00	PopMatters	62.0	These songs are ethereal to a fault, unable to gain a foothold in memory. If Portico continue down this path, they’re liable to become faceless where they were once exhilarating.
What Is This Heart?	How to Dress Well	R&B;	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	69.0	There’s no staggering departure from Total Loss, but the backdrop for his soulful R&B; crooning is becoming worn-out, and you can feel Krell auditioning replacements.

Rolling Papers	Wiz Khalifa	Rap	2011-03-29 00:00:00	AllMusic	59.0	Just like any given Bone album, Khalifa's chilled and confused Rolling Papers is an acquired taste, and while it's misrepresented by its single and the mixtapes that surround it, it is purposeful mood music, perfect for bong loading or just hanging out.
Octopus	The Bees [Band of Bees]	Indie	2007-03-26 00:00:00	Playlouder	70.0	Staunch fans won't be disappointed, but it's hard to envisage new ears pricking up on hearing 'Octopus' woeful musings.
Film School	Film School	Indie	2006-01-24 00:00:00	Pitchfork	66.0	At times, Film School achieve a foggy, grandiose psychedelia, but their compositions aren't always as shimmering as their production.

Melted	Ty Segall	Pop/Rock	2010-05-25 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	82.0	At times Melted falls into the familiar lo-fi production trap: lack of variety in sound and tempo.

Ten Silver Drops	Secret Machines	Indie	2006-04-25 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	75.0	While it's admirable that The Secret Machines are trying to solidify their niche as the go-to guys for soundtracking laser light shows (or at least My Morning Jacket for indoor kids), Ten Silver Drops is a sideways moonwalk that won't get them any further away from the planetarium circuit.

Body Talk, Pt. 2	Robyn	Pop	2010-09-07 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	76.0	On the first three tracks, she tackles enduring pop-music themes like love, loneliness and friendship with the kind of unsentimental yet empathetic songwriting fans of the Pet Shop Boys might admire. Midway, her worldly confidence morphs into outright cockiness and the beats grow aggressive.

Thing	Trans Am	Indie	2010-04-20 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	72.0	For the duration of their career, Trans Am have described landscapes as if from a balloon, as if the universe is readily recognizable, and yet they've continued to do so with an oddly hued and surreal perspective. Thing welcomingly continues this delicate balance between the strange and the familiar.
Ancient Romans	Sun Araw	Pop/Rock	2011-08-23 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	75.0	There's a real, meticulous attempt at achieving the same playful, wandering state of mind of the pre-'80s experimental classics that inspire these songs, rather than pulling from any overwhelming examples.
Wolves Within	After the Burial	Pop/Rock	2013-12-17 00:00:00	AllMusic	72.0	After the Burial might have a sound that's heavier and more mechanical than their prog forefathers, but that doesn't diminish the massive amounts of technical and creative power at work on Wolves Within.

Standell-Preston recording her half in Canada and Cowan his half in Europe. The resulting music gathered here has a strange lack of centre which produces a dreamlike vibe. Even the techno tracks sound disembodied. Never is there a sense of ennui or tedium on these tracks. For every dub techno moodscape their is a pretty dream pop song.Untogether is the sound of a couple working apart with the space between filled with a sense of yearning and dissociation. From the giddy love of Blooming Summer to the ghostly detachment of Untogether Blue Hawaii have produced two contrasting albums reflecting contrasting sides of a romantic, musical relationship.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;

Under The Skin	Lindsey Buckingham	Rock	2006-10-03 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	80.0	With its skewed pop melodies, home-brewed sonic trickery and blazing fingerpicking, Under the Skin is a mesmerizing return to the side of Buckingham that birthed the proto-indie-pop strangeness of 1979's Tusk.
The Fall	Norah Jones	Rock	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Mojo	73.0	"The wrong kind of sonic adventure undermines about half the songs. A drop of Waitsian, drunken, junkyard percussion might have been just the ticket, but the plethora of drony guitar and keyboard distortions proves distracting, rather than ""atmospheric"", and impairs the effect of some strong songs including Back To Manhattan and Stuck.

Sleep Through The Static	Jack Johnson	Rock	2008-02-05 00:00:00	Billboard	61.0	Saying that Jack Johnson's fourth record is languid and breezy is a little like saying the Cubs probably won't win it all this year, but Sleep Through the Static takes Johnson's über-chill, barefoot-in-a-hammock vibe to new heights--or mediums, depending on how you look at such things.

None Shall Pass	Aesop Rock	Rap	2007-08-28 00:00:00	Village Voice	74.0	You can't decipher most of what he's saying, and sometimes you're better off. And the beats, provided variously by Blockhead, El-P, and Aesop himself, are rarely more than serviceable.

Eskimo Snow	Why?	Indie	2009-09-22 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	76.0	Sacrificing none of their self-effacement in their pursuit of a more emotionally direct style, WHY? have stumbled upon something uniquely personal yet utterly commercial.
Lateralus	Tool	Rock	2001-05-15 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	75.0	The music has a clean, fluid flow but sounds thin-blooded and far less visceral -- freeze-dried -- next to newer, younger Ozzfest regulars, like Staind, who have followed in Tool's wake. [25 May 2001, p.77]

It could have been very promising if there were more intricate elements added to the sound of each song. For me, the bass line in most of the songs were very repetitive and there were way too many filler songs in between.

Blood Pressures	The Kills	Pop/Rock	2011-04-05 00:00:00	Hackskeptic	76.0	"Well, there are a few odd turns, but ""Blood Pressures"" is pretty much the same amalgam of raw, tense, amateurish delivery that's been conveyedWell, there are a few odd turns, but ""Blood Pressures"" is pretty much the same amalgam of raw, tense, amateurish delivery that's been conveyed throughout their career. Mosshart has undoubtedly improved her skills over the years and can perform a fairly convincing torch singer's touch (""The Last Goodbye"") along with her usual tortured moans. By contrast, when Hince steps up to sing on the turgid ""Wild Charms"" one suggests he should concentrate solely on instrumental duties.Leaving behind the more dance oriented rhythms of ""Midnight Boom"", and although aiming for the carnal blues rock of ""No Wow"" there's a cleaner, less energised feel to the record. The cod reggae of ""Satellite"" sounds like it's powered by Prozac, and the resignation in Mosshart's vocal on ""DNA"" suggests minimal enthusiasm to the cause. She saves her best performance for ""The Last Goodbye""; a melancholic piano ballad that resonates with an emotional intensity rarely found on the rest of this collection. For fans, ""Blood Pressures"" is a fine if sanitized version of former glories. With all the activity away from the band, one wonders if hooking up once again was more obligatory than inspirational, and may explain the tame, uninspired nature of this recording. http://hackskeptic.com&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"
B-Room	Dr. Dog	Pop/Rock	2013-10-01 00:00:00	Under The Radar	73.0	These tunes are ripe and ready for picking, the fruitful results of a band that grows infectious melodies by watering them with good instincts. [Aug-Sep 2013, p.89]
The New Romance	Pretty Girls Make Graves	Indie	2003-09-09 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	74.0	Pretty Girls Make Graves fall slightly short of their ambitions and capabilities, producing songs that are good, even very good, but less than what they&#146;ve proved themselves to be capable of.
Making Dens	Mystery Jets	Indie	2006-03-06 00:00:00	Pitchfork	74.0	Though the restless time changes and laser-show synth overtures betray prog-rock's ostentatious influence, the tightly constructed songs here (all but two of which stay under the five-minute mark) bristle with a passion and purpose that belongs only to the truly committed and composed.

Who Killed The Zutons	The Zutons	Indie	2004-10-19 00:00:00	Q Magazine	73.0	McCabe details a stoner's humdrum city life a touch too convincingly at times, but the spirit of musical adventure is nonetheless commendable.  [May 2004, p.111]

Seven's Travels	Atmosphere	Indie	2003-09-23 00:00:00	Splendid	72.0	Though it's not the emotionally draining follow-up many were expecting, Seven's Travels succeeds. Its saving grace is the fact that Slug and Ant remain ignorant of, or choose to completely ignore, the hip-hop conventions that have handcuffed similar artists for almost a decade.
Electric Sweat	Mooney Suzuki	Indie	2002-04-09 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	77.0	Though the group doesn't find the level of personal expression that's converted The White Stripes into a star cult act, it's at the head of the class of minor-league neo-garage bands, on a par with Cincinnati's The Greenhornes or Nashville's The Obscure.
Dear God, I Hate Myself	Xiu Xiu	Indie	2010-02-23 00:00:00	Pitchfork	74.0	New listeners will be immediately confronted with a couple of very catchy, horror-laced new wave anthems about fatal beatings and bulimia, and make that perennial first-Xiu-Xiu-experience decision: Do I buy this?
Three-Four	Shipping News	Indie	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Splendid	63.0	While there's nothing too stunning to be found on Three-Four, there's also nothing really sub-par.

Hot Fuss	The Killers	Rock	2004-06-15 00:00:00	PopMatters	66.0	What's most shocking about Hot Fuss, though, is how, after five sensational songs, the rest of the album completely implodes, as the other six tracks get weighed down by too much production, a lack of memorable hooks, and some inexplicable musical touches that may have sounded clever in the studio, but wind up sounding disastrous on the CD.

Oohs & Aahs	Say Hi	Indie	2009-03-03 00:00:00	PopMatters	62.0	Oohs and Aahs invites us in right off the bat, but once we’re there it spends too much of its time ignoring us, curling into its own sound instead of projecting it out for us to be a part of.

The Female Boss	Tulisa	Pop	2012-12-03 00:00:00	Q Magazine	35.0	Tulisa struggles to get to grips with the predictably generic R&B; ballads, but when the pace is upped and she shouts along to Young and the feisty M.I.A.-lite Live It Up, the personality that has turned her into a phenomenon of out times transcends her obvious limitations.

White Women	Chromeo	Electronic	2014-05-12 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	66.0	Featuring the ever-glorious Solange on vocals, it’s a moment of gracefulness that showcases Chromeo’s evident knowledge of when and how to take things down a notch. As a result, it largely accounts for the mostly-pleasant ride that the duo take us on with White Women.
The Life Pursuit	Belle & Sebastian	Indie	2006-02-07 00:00:00	AllMusic	78.0	It's not a radical departure for Belle & Sebastian -- there are several intimate, folky numbers that would comfortably fit on their previous records.

But it's not enough to smooth the edges off ""Arc Arsenal,"" a primal tantrum against rebels ""robbed . . . of their cause,"" or to homogenize the ragged beats and mind-bending guitar flurries of ""Enfilade."""
Junip	Junip	Pop/Rock	2013-04-23 00:00:00	Clash Music	75.0	At their best though, Junip’s exotic folk gems have a slow-burning charm and are an impressive step forward from Gonzalez’s easy listening cover versions.

8 Diagrams	Wu-Tang Clan	Rap	2007-12-11 00:00:00	Lost At Sea	73.0	8 Diagrams is intricate, inoffensive, interesting.
The Moon & Antarctica	Modest Mouse	Indie	2000-06-13 00:00:00	RoverJones	82.0	Staggering. A masterpiece of sound, ambition, ambiance, and songwriting, this album is something that no alt-rock collection is complete without.
Cosmos Rocks	Queen + Paul Rodgers	Rock	2008-10-28 00:00:00	AllMusic	42.0	Certainly, it's not the embarrassment of the live album, but it has its own internal logic that keeps it humming along, and that's good enough for a listen and to get the band out on tour again, even it's not good enough for a second spin.
All of Us, Together	Teen Daze	Electronic	2012-06-05 00:00:00	Filter	60.0	This record is not out to shatter you; its aim, rather, is to fuel your night drive through the dusky electronic corridors of sun-warmed youth.
Face The Truth	Stephen Malkmus	Indie	2005-05-24 00:00:00	Serdil	78.0	"If not too modest to say, one of the best indie-rock albums of the decade. such beautiful sound, experimental atmosphere and songwriting. notIf not too modest to say, one of the best indie-rock albums of the decade. such beautiful sound, experimental atmosphere and songwriting. not only can the progress be easily observed in his solo career, but also so much added up to pavement era. the album cant fit into any structures or boundaries, hence we call it ""indie-rock"" but it is erratic (in a good way) even in his own genre. it seems his relationship with the instrument has come to a very mature yet energetic state. he sounds more cynical as he&#039;s been there, done that. in the meantime, despite not being screamy-shouty, you can sense a refined and more deconstructive aggression. a note, the whole album should be listened in a stereo soundsystem with a distance between speakers. you&#039;ll get the difference.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"
Thank You, Happy Birthday	Cage the Elephant	Pop/Rock	2011-01-11 00:00:00	No Ripcord	76.0	Is this record the cure to the ails that is the sophomore LP?  Yes and no.  Yes, it's new and fresh and spilling over with more of their unique brand of high-energy rock; no, as there's some missteps and growth is often traded out for immature jabs.
Hotel Paper	Michelle Branch	Pop	2003-06-24 00:00:00	PopMatters	57.0	Most of the songs just lumber along at the same plodding, deliberate pace, boasting very few of the fun hooks that made her previous album so annoyingly likeable.
An End Has A Start	Editors	Indie	2007-07-17 00:00:00	Playlouder	65.0	This album is fucking brilliant – it made me want to cut my hair, paint the ceiling, fuck the postman and burn the disco down. So I did. Then I curled up in a corner, cried, and shat myself.
Transparent Things	Fujiya & Miyagi	Indie	2007-01-23 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	79.0	It comes as no surprise that Fujiya & Miyagi's sound recalls other neo-futurists.... But Fujiya & Miyagi is undeniably its own band, with peppy melodicism and upfront sense of humor.
The Art of Love and War	Angie Stone	R&B;	2007-10-16 00:00:00	The Guardian	60.0	That mood of indulgence also leads to a surfeit of mellifluous vocals, syrupy beats and billowing, sugary melodies that makes the album cloy.
Nobody's Daughter	Hole	Rock	2010-04-27 00:00:00	Billboard.com	57.0	"Nobody's Daughter recalls the highlights of the band's critically acclaimed 1994 album, ""Live Through This,"" and shows that, as a band, Hole is not one bit damaged."

The Original Faces	Helen	Pop/Rock	2015-09-04 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	80.0	The memory of the dream’s worth nothing, but you’ll chase the feeling all day. This album is a lot like that.
The Long Goodbye: Live at Madison Square Garden	LCD Soundsystem	Electronic	2014-05-19 00:00:00	Pitchfork	75.0	The music is undeniably alive, even though--or perhaps because--the band that made it is all over.

Complete Strangers	Vetiver	Pop/Rock	2015-03-24 00:00:00	Uncut	64.0	The record is as intimate and low-key as an evening home with friends. [May 2015, p.84]
In Focus?	Shugo Tokumaru	Pop/Rock	2013-01-22 00:00:00	Pitchfork	79.0	Though it makes left turns and constantly tweaks its formulas, In Focus? is admirably coherent and cohesive, with each little pile-up of ideas finding its place in the big pile-up of ideas that comprises the album.
Smother	Wild Beasts	Pop/Rock	2011-05-10 00:00:00	Delusions of Adequacy	85.0	"Although Smother isn't as suffocating as perhaps it should be, it's still an interesting venture for Wild Beasts to have taken and definitely, a worthy follow-up to Two Dancers. And so while there isn't anything as wildly inventive as maybe ""Hooting & Howling"" anywhere to be found, there is a great deal of lingering new sounds to get lost in."
The Trouble With Being Myself	Macy Gray	Pop	2003-07-15 00:00:00	Dot Music	74.0	Unfortunately, none of it's even remotely memorable.
Is This It?	The Strokes	Rock	2001-10-09 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	91.0	For now, the Strokes have mastered their style; they have yet to come up with the substance to match it.... But the music leaves no doubts - more joyful and intense than anything else I've heard this year.
Truly She Is None Other	Holly Golightly	Indie	2003-07-29 00:00:00	Mojo	83.0	Her sultry rasp--think Nancy Sinatra meets Bettye Lavette--delivers disquieting, brooding self-penned originals over warped, folk-tinged, electric blues. [Sep 2003, p.110]
Dirty Work	All Time Low	Pop/Rock	2011-06-07 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	67.0	On their fourth album, All Time Low get stranded between bratty snot-rock and witty power pop.
ARTPOP	Lady Gaga	Pop	2013-11-11 00:00:00	Exclaim	61.0	ARTPOP is a dynamic, memorable album that, while it fails to unveil the girl behind the aura, reveals a performer who finally sounds as invested in her art as she is in her image.

So-Called Chaos	Alanis Morissette	Rock	2004-05-18 00:00:00	Blender	56.0	Her signature sound -- voice snarling through a tangle of massed guitars -- is here, but so is a softer, more vulnerable tone. The melodies, while radio-ready, have a stomping insistence.

Christmas In The Heart	Bob Dylan	Rock	2009-10-13 00:00:00	Billboard.com	62.0	Christmas in the Heart is an odd one-a collection of straight-ahead Christmas songs that benefits Feeding America, as well as food charities in other countries. But it will remind listeners that for nearly a decade Dylan has been working on his croon-exploring musical styles that are more polished than folk and blues.
It's Never Been Like That	Phoenix	Indie	2006-05-23 00:00:00	Mojo	72.0	For all the frenetic energy, lush orchestration and earnest vocals, however, It's Never Been Like That has the feel of the work of a hollow band. [Jun 2006, p.110]
Are We There Yet?	The Citizens	Indie	2004-09-01 00:00:00	Splendid	73.0	The unpredictable song structures are fresh and innovative, too, twisting off in unexpected directions mere seconds before you can remember what they remind you of.
Songbook [Live]	Chris Cornell	Pop/Rock	2011-11-21 00:00:00	Kerrang!	71.0	Good lord, what a voice Chris Cornell has - rich, bruised, defiant, fragile and strong, be bends it to his will. On Songbook ... [his voice] carries the album as it stands starkly against his simple guitar backing. [Nov. 19, 2011p. 51]
I Wake Up Screaming	Kid Creole & the Coconuts	Pop/Rock	2011-09-12 00:00:00	Blurt Magazine	75.0	I Wake Up Screaming is an absolute delight, a rhythmically exhilarating, lyrically humorous, melodically intoxicating collection of thirteen terrific songs.
Dear Heather	Leonard Cohen	Rock	2004-10-26 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	74.0	Pretty much nothing from Dear Heather is without some kind of significant flaw, and the only thing saving it from being below average---at least in a general sense, and not kept strictly to his own discography----are the few moments that Cohen is kept solitary with as little outside interference as possible.
Pebble To A Pearl	Nikka Costa	R&B;	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Under The Radar	67.0	Costa has always been more a purist, but Justin Stanley's feline production inflates her torpid lyrics. [Fall 2008, p.86]
Yucca	Milk Maid	Pop/Rock	2011-07-19 00:00:00	Q Magazine	64.0	Yucca is pure pop primitivism that's all distorted vocals and fuzzy guitar swirls, just like The Jesus And Mary Chain never happened. [Aug 2011, p.126]
I'm with You	Red Hot Chili Peppers	Pop/Rock	2011-08-30 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	63.0	The peak moments on I'm With You balance swagger and sensitivity.
Saint Dymphna	Gang Gang Dance	Rock	2008-10-21 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	78.0	There's something downright overwhelming about this disc, whether it's the unremitting playfulness or the way the band pulls together beauty and energy from the oddest of sounds or the way over top they sometimes launch into abstract political commentary.
Tender New Signs	Tamaryn	Pop/Rock	2012-10-16 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	72.0	Whether it be the quaint elegance and flowing, reverb heavy guitars of kaleidoscopic opener 'I'm Gone' or claustrophobic haze of album standout 'Heavenly Bodies', there's little here that disappoints.
Hotel Valentine	Cibo Matto	Pop/Rock	2014-02-14 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	75.0	Hotel Valentine isn’t just a soundtrack to non-existent film, but an otherworldly excursion unto itself, best experienced with headphones on and eyes shut.
Salad Days	Mac DeMarco	Pop/Rock	2014-04-01 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	82.0	The music never seems to come from a place of desire to convey something true or honest from within DeMarco, but instead it paints variations of past emotions, interpret others’ honesty, gives a distorted remembrance of the past for a more entertaining present.
4eva N A Day	Big K.R.I.T.	Rap	2012-03-05 00:00:00	Expert Witness (MSN Music)	78.0	"Almost every soulful track grew on me, with the clincher ""Down & Out,"" one of his periodic explanations of why sometimes he sips and smokes instead of trying yet again."
Night On Fire	VHS or Beta	Indie	2004-09-21 00:00:00	MatthewT	60.0	Many have already made the high quality of this album known in their comments, so i shall simply defend it from those who single out theMany have already made the high quality of this album known in their comments, so i shall simply defend it from those who single out the production and the instrumentals...quite frankly, i cannot find fault with the production which seems crisp and suited to the music...and the instrumentals...what&#039;s wrong with them? Do songs have to have lyrics to be good? In my opinion the instrumentals add variety to an already quality album, which contains no filler, but plenty of quality 80s style music with a beat that makes your hips want to wiggle and your arms want to dance...GO VHS OR BETA GO!&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Strawberry Jam	Animal Collective	Indie	2007-09-11 00:00:00	Dot Music	79.0	This album's reduced sonic density is both refreshing and slightly disappointing, since the confounding head-rush of their tunes was always a large part of their appeal.
This Is Still It	The Method Actors	Rock	2010-03-06 00:00:00	BBC Music	86.0	The pair can knock out enormous, memorable hooks from limited resources, the instrumental make-up stripped-bare in the extreme, just drums and guitar. But scarcity of equipment never once hinders their considerable ambition and inventiveness.
To Lose My Life	White Lies	Rock	2009-03-17 00:00:00	Under The Radar	58.0	To Lose My Life is satisfying and consisitent throughout, even if White Lies treads daringly close to one-trick-pony territory. [Spring 2009, p.75]
In Rape Fantasy And Terror Sex We Trust	Joan of Arc	Indie	2003-05-27 00:00:00	AllMusic	63.0	Joan of Arc have once more surpassed themselves as artists.
Former Lives	Benjamin Gibbard	Pop/Rock	2012-10-16 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	70.0	While it's obviously been personally cathartic, you have to think that it's far from the best record Benjamin could have put out.

The Meat Of Life	Clem Snide	Indie	2010-02-23 00:00:00	PopMatters	67.0	It may not quite match up to their best work—which is, for my money, The Ghost of Fashion—but it’s a sure sign that they’re on their way back to that high-watermark.
Plague Park	Handsome Furs	Indie	2007-05-22 00:00:00	ChristianH	72.0	All songs save Dumb Animals are easy to listen to continuously. I love this CD.
Radical Connector	Mouse on Mars	Electronic	2004-08-24 00:00:00	Junkmedia	75.0	The compositions on Connector are firmer, more contained than they've been since 1997's Audoditacker.
Black Sun	Kode9	Electronic	2011-04-26 00:00:00	Q Magazine	80.0	His second album evokes blade Runner's stylish futurism, populating it with Spaceape's paranoid poetry and drowning clean lines in tape crackle. [May 2011, p.119]
Sonik Kicks	Paul Weller	Pop/Rock	2012-03-27 00:00:00	Q Magazine	77.0	All the evidence anyone needs that the 50-something Weller is in the midst of a supersonic prime. [Mar 2012, p. 98]

Her debut record may have been better in terms of lyrical contentI purchased this album a couple years back off of eBay and I was surprised.  Her debut record may have been better in terms of lyrical content and production, but this record shows a edgier and more dance oriented side of C and it's a good one.  Standout tracks on the album are ""The itch"", ""I Know What Boys Like"" and ""Special"".  Songs that are good but are under achieved are ""Sex Has Come Between Us"", ""Busted"" and ""That Was Then This is Now'.  Overall, a nice album and is still original 11 years later.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"
Staind	Staind	Pop/Rock	2011-09-13 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	55.0	Our current decade shows relative promise for the red-capped skeletons in our dusty CD cabinet, with Staind left proving pleasant results can occasionally lie past an act's alleged retirement age.
Custom Built	Bret Michaels	Pop/Rock	2010-07-06 00:00:00	American Songwriter	49.0	Writing this review would be so much easier if you didn't seem like such a nice dude and if you hadn't had such a disaster fraught year so far. we'd totally let into you about that Miley Cyrus duet and probably scold you for including that atrocious remix of the Rock of Love theme, but frankly, we can't. Not now anyway.
The Physical World	Death from Above 1979	Pop/Rock	2014-09-09 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	75.0	With The Physical World, Death From Above 1979 both embraces its dance-punk roots and transcends them.
The Fade in Time	Sam Lee	Folk	2015-03-16 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	89.0	This music is restless but keenly aware, finding common ground and intersections between a range of source material and contemporary contexts and, most importantly of all, delivering these songs with honesty, conviction and genuine feeling.
Zaba	Glass Animals	Pop/Rock	2014-06-10 00:00:00	Q Magazine	77.0	Glass Animals have mapped out a vivid, intoxicating soundworld of their own. [Jul 2014, p.107]
Minimum Rock N Roll	Chain & the Gang	Pop/Rock	2014-04-14 00:00:00	The Line of Best Fit	70.0	It’s not as thrilling or elemental as his earlier work, but Minimum Rock N Roll is a hell of a lot of fun.
Because the Internet	Childish Gambino	Rap	2013-12-10 00:00:00	HipHopDX	64.0	Childish Gambino still manages to mostly hold our attention, though, because he concerns himself instead with his own terms.
Coming Out of the Fog	Arbouretum	Pop/Rock	2013-01-22 00:00:00	Pitchfork	70.0	On Fog, Arbouretum does well by both parties [his songwriting influences:  singer Will Oldham, with whom he toured as a backing guitarist, and Baltimore punk-rock-Gnostics, Lungfish].
Postcards From a Young Man	Manic Street Preachers	Pop/Rock	2010-09-21 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	76.0	For all the furious posturing, the message is veneered too neatly with streamlined riffs and swamped too deep in nice-as-pie orchestral melodies. Seething rants seem to pack more of a punch when the product is less polished, and tend to get lost when bookended with excessively opulent trappings. This is rock music, after all.
Danzig in the Moonlight	Ken Stringfellow	Pop/Rock	2012-10-16 00:00:00	PopMatters	67.0	All in all, Danzig in the Moonlight is a startlingly average record.
Eating Us	Black Moth Super Rainbow	Indie	2009-05-26 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	74.0	The like-minded follow-up enlists Flaming Lips producer Dave Fridmann, who highlights the tingly interplay between acoustic and electronic instruments and the processed vocals, which generally sound like T-Pain tripping his balls off.
Broken Ear Record	Black Dice	Indie	2005-09-06 00:00:00	Pitchfork	70.0	It's flighty, frustrating, and at times a little frigid, but intelligent and never lacking in momentum.
Everyday Robots	Damon Albarn	Pop/Rock	2014-04-29 00:00:00	PopMatters	76.0	It’s a “grower” if there ever was one. And when it finally blooms in your ears, you’ll find yourself thinking “ah, so this is why I’ve been following this guy for all these years.”
Truly She Is None Other	Holly Golightly	Indie	2003-07-29 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	83.0	A set of appealing folk-rock ditties shot through with girl-group sweetness and a soupcon of punky attitude. [1 Aug 2003, p.79]
In Love And Death	The Used	Rock	2004-09-28 00:00:00	AllMusic	64.0	Though its heart is eventually lost amidst the guiding elements of the genre, the Used's In Love and Death does make some impressive moves away from those very same tenets, showing some welcome restraint and even some rocktastic energy.
Yeah Right	Bleeding Rainbow	Pop/Rock	2013-01-29 00:00:00	Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM)	65.0	Yeah Right’s dual interests in songwriting and guitar explorations end up being its greatest strength.

Spend The Night	The Donnas	Rock	2002-10-22 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	74.0	But for all The Donnas' ongoing charms, Spend The Night tempers them with a faint whiff of predictability.
Shadows	Teenage Fanclub	Rock	2010-06-08 00:00:00	Under The Radar	81.0	Whereas most of their albums have had at least one or two weak tracks, every tune on Shadows is tight and fully developed. [Spring 2010, p.65]

The Ragpicker's Dream	Mark Knopfler	Rock	2002-10-01 00:00:00	Blender	62.0	If his subject matter is getting stranger, however, his semiacoustic music is comfortingly familiar and expert. [#11, p.135]
rEvolver	T-Pain	Rap	2011-12-06 00:00:00	PopMatters	56.0	An album that feels dated right as it hits the shelves, and professes no argument for its significance other than some big name features and producers.

Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper	Panda Bear	Pop/Rock	2015-01-13 00:00:00	The Observer (UK)	82.0	Lennox still sounds unmistakably like his peaceable bear self, despite having acquired some new carnivorous companions whose firepower, critically, he doesn’t need.
Cut 4 Me [Mixtape]	Kelela	Pop/Rock	2013-10-01 00:00:00	CMJ	81.0	Cut 4 Me ends leaving the listener with a dizzying feeling and a cooly slowed pulse. Now we have expectations.

Stay Gold	First Aid Kit	Pop/Rock	2014-06-10 00:00:00	PopMatters	80.0	For all the dusty byways covered on Stay Gold, First Aid Kit shows to be wise beyond their years.
Before The Dawn Heals Us	M83	Electronic	2005-01-25 00:00:00	ShakingThrough.net	76.0	On the whole, Before The Dawn Heals Us is a more unified, singular vision than Dead Cities.
The  Human Romance	Darkest Hour	Pop/Rock	2011-02-22 00:00:00	Sputnikmusic	74.0	It's safe to say that Darkest Hour are not as good as they used to be--sorry, fans, but The Eternal Return and The Human Romance are both indicators of that. But the band have certainly got their bearings back this year and have made the best album that they possibly could have without Kris Norris.
Let Us Never Speak Of It Again	Out Hud	Indie	2005-03-22 00:00:00	Junkmedia	76.0	Songs walk a delicate tightrope between the brain and the hips, and the libidinal release of the beat is denied, suggested, suppressed, and finally let loose to sweat it out.
We Were Dead Before The Ship Even Sank	Modest Mouse	Indie	2007-03-20 00:00:00	ShakingThrough.net	78.0	Clearly, what we’re dealing with here isn’t a new Modest Mouse, but one with a few new, calculated tricks.
Upright Behavior	Landlady	Pop/Rock	2014-07-15 00:00:00	PopMatters	74.0	It all feels a bit cosmic and a bit domestic, and that’s not unrelated to the way they play the songs--both tightly focused and freewheeling.

Madvillainy	Madvillain	Indie	2004-03-23 00:00:00	KevinL	93.0	Wow...this is freaking dope...man this ...is the bomb...I reccomend this to all hip hop and underground rap fans.
The River In Reverse	Elvis Costello & Allen Toussaint	Rock	2006-06-06 00:00:00	Pitchfork	78.0	Most of these tracks merely feel professional or workmanlike, sincere recordings that sadly lack inspiration.
Light Chasers	Cloud Cult	Pop/Rock	2010-09-14 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	72.0	Minowa, who also produced, dives in with typical gusto, building the album into a sprawling, intricately interconnected 56-minute concept that often soars into emotionally operatic, cathartic heights.
Uno!	Green Day	Alternative/Indie Rock	2012-09-25 00:00:00	Absolute Punk (Staff reviews)	67.0	There are some parts you'll have to suffer through, but there are at least a handful of tracks that we can save and enjoy into the future.
Diver	Lemonade	Pop/Rock	2012-05-29 00:00:00	The Boston Phoenix	64.0	Diver is depressingly one-note, trimming back the band's scope and muscle. For some reason, Callan Clendenin sings every line in the same tiring, vacant croon, and its charm fades with each track, as does the Garageband-style production.
Animal Joy	Shearwater	Pop/Rock	2012-02-14 00:00:00	The Quietus	76.0	Instead of a coherent collection of songs, Animal Joy feels like a series of very clever blueprints that, while admirable in form, are often (despite that title), rather bloodless.
See Mystery Lights	YACHT	Indie	2009-08-04 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	70.0	Brainy and block-rocking rarely coexist like this.
Brighter Than Creation's Dark	Drive-By Truckers	Indie	2008-01-22 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	83.0	John Neff’s expert, dreamy pedal steel and Shonna Tucker’s soothing, pitch-perfect harmony -- somewhere between Lucinda Williams and Neko Case--make Brighter another solid entry in the band's catalog.
Lead Us Not Into Temptation	David Byrne	Indie	2003-09-09 00:00:00	Uncut	79.0	Sincere and beautiful. [Nov 2003, p.116]
The Sound Of The Smiths	The Smiths	Indie	2008-11-11 00:00:00	Q Magazine	88.0	The lasting impression os of music full of a magic and panache that a mere compilation album can't quite reflect. [dec 2008, p.136]
There's Me And There's You	The Matthew Herbert Big Band	Electronic	2008-10-28 00:00:00	Under The Radar	60.0	The music’s so great that Eska’s vocals are often intrusive and sometimes embarrassing. [Year End 2008]
Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty	Big Boi	Rap	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Spin	90.0	Aided by producers Organized Noize and Mr. DJ, Sir Lucious Left Foot is a monster of an album.
Last Dance	Charlie Haden	Jazz	2014-06-17 00:00:00	PopMatters	81.0	Here they are again, the two of them, often partners before, playing mostly love songs--and all GREAT songs--and making them sound both classic and new, both simple and profound, simultaneously dangerous and comforting and revelatory.
Jewellery	Micachu & the Shapes	Indie	2009-04-07 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	75.0	Anyone who has found beauty in a chipped tooth or a grazed knee will find much to love here. Jewellery certainly doesn’t suffer from a paucity of ideas, and the lyrical subjects are more than a match for the band’s heterogeneous musical leanings.
Rescue	Silverstein	Pop/Rock	2011-04-26 00:00:00	fistofan0077	69.0	"I love Silverstein, and their new album is the first by an artist I've liked for a few years released this year that I really like. All theI love Silverstein, and their new album is the first by an artist I've liked for a few years released this year that I really like. All the songs are equal to each other, there are enough heavier songs and enough smoother songs in there. None of the songs come off as particularly harder than usual, and some of the environmental overtones that drowned out ""A Shipwreck in the Sand"" are no longer here. I enjoyed the album a lot, much like all of their previous ones, and if you're a fan, you should obviously check it out as well. I'll even recommend it for non-fans. A lot of songs seem softer than previously, but still have the same Silverstein feel, and if you've yet to check them out, I'd recommend this as one of the albums by them you decide to check out.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"
Sail Out [EP]	Jhené Aiko	R&B;	2013-11-11 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	69.0	On Sail Out, Jhené Aiko remains on her cloud, delivering 30 minutes of alt-R&B; respite from reality, displaying soothing vocals, double-entendre-laden wordplay and a knack for choosing collaborators.

Love Is Simple	Akron/Family	Indie	2007-09-18 00:00:00	MattD.	74.0	I crank this album up all the time.
Candela	Mice Parade	Electronic	2013-01-29 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	65.0	Candela doesn't represent Mice Parade's most memorable outing, but it does showcase a willingness to expand the expectations surrounding their sound.
Knock Madness	Hopsin	Rap	2013-11-24 00:00:00	AllMusic	77.0	Third time’s the charm for horrorcore rapper Hopsin, as the angry and often awful character balances his aggressive, violent vocal style with more pop and approachable music during the rewarding Knock Madness.
The Besnard Lakes Are The Roaring Night	The Besnard Lakes	Rock	2010-03-09 00:00:00	Q Magazine	80.0	"The enveloping crescendos of ""Albatross"" define the album's blend of  beauty and pure power in a record that puts ""classic"" back into classic rock. [Apr 2010, p.106]"
The  Big Dream	David Lynch	Jazz	2013-07-16 00:00:00	Under The Radar	64.0	This is an unrelentingly difficult record, with all semblances of pop music and even melody eschewed for a Hound of the Baskervilles trudge through a gothic swamp.
Humming By The Flowered Vine	Laura Cantrell	Indie	2005-06-21 00:00:00	Lost At Sea	80.0	You’d be hard-pressed to find a music snob who can’t be won over by Cantrell’s lovely compositions.
Reflektor	Arcade Fire	Pop/Rock	2013-10-29 00:00:00	Punknews.org (Staff)	80.0	Arcade Fire managed to satisfy divergent interests. Disc one is the hits. Disc two is the weird stuff.
Bad News Boys	The King Khan & BBQ Show	Pop/Rock	2015-02-24 00:00:00	Uncut	76.0	Entirely unoriginal, but the sort of thing that, 55 years after it was invented, it's still hard to get enough of. [Apr 2015, p.77]
Blood for the Master	Goatwhore	Pop/Rock	2012-02-14 00:00:00	Pitchfork	61.0	For a band that's lyrically so devoted to upsetting the order, Goatwhore sound unequivocally content with replaying the past.
Get Ready	New Order	Rock	2001-10-16 00:00:00	Mojo	72.0	Much of Get Ready is less a call to arms than the sound of an old man wheezing out of a creaky armchair. [Sep 2001, p.108]
Sugaring Season	Beth Orton	Alternative/Indie Rock	2012-10-02 00:00:00	Q Magazine	76.0	This folk-rooted album is ideal for listeners who think they're tired of folk music. [Nov 2012, p.94]
All My Friends Are Funeral Singers	Califone	Rock	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	78.0	If All My Friends Are Funeral Singers has said one thing at all to me, it’s that Califone merit further investigation, especially for someone who tends to write off ‘folk’ music. And if that doesn’t make it a success, then I don’t know what does.
Say It	Born Ruffians	Indie	2010-06-01 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	66.0	By focusing inwards, Born Ruffians have done that whole 'maturing' thing that us reviewers like to talk about, and created a much improved piece of art.
The New Year	The New Year	Indie	2008-09-09 00:00:00	Filter	77.0	The band puls science closer to post-rock with songs like fractals, repeating notes until you don't think you can bear their recurrance, then spangling out into gorgeous odes to the passage of time and the beauty of the loss therein. [Fall 2008, p.102]
Red Kite	Sarah Cracknell	Pop/Rock	2015-06-15 00:00:00	Mojo	75.0	The melodies are sunny, but Red Kite glimpses the brilliant glare of summer through a morning fog which stubbornly refuses to clear. [Aug 2015, p.94]
With the Dawn	Bella Hardy	Folk	2015-03-30 00:00:00	The Guardian	80.0	This adventurous new work mixes intimate, drifting ballads and pop choruses, and is backed by an intriguing mix of her own fiddle, banjo, brass and percussion.
Push the Sky Away	Nick Cave And The Bad Seeds	Pop/Rock	2013-02-19 00:00:00	Fact Magazine (UK)	81.0	It might be their fifteenth album in a 30-year career, but Push The Sky Away proves beyond all doubt--even mine--that the group is still at the top of their game.
Bosnian Rainbows	Bosnian Rainbows	Pop/Rock	2013-06-25 00:00:00	DIY Magazine	72.0	It's very different, and whether or not it's better than The Mars Volta is a debate for others; what is clear is that Omar Rodriguez Lopez--and friends--still have a lot more to offer.
The Violence	Darren Hayman & the Long Parliament	Pop/Rock	2012-11-05 00:00:00	Uncut	81.0	His is a personal, emotive take, and it proves very effective. [Dec 2012, p.72]
Clapton	Eric Clapton	Pop/Rock	2010-09-28 00:00:00	Uncut	72.0	It's yielded his best solo album in years. Rather than home, it's actually a close-knit kind of jam session. [Oct 2010, p.96]
Nomad	Bombino	Pop/Rock	2013-04-02 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	84.0	Nomad is more than a beautiful offering for the world music crowd. It's the defining work of a guitar hero.
Uncle Dysfunktional	Happy Mondays	Rock	2007-07-02 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	57.0	This comeback effort is a huge amount of fun and a reminder that it's great that the Happy Mondays have never completely disappeared.
Fragments of Freedom	Morcheeba	Rock	2000-08-01 00:00:00	Sonicnet	62.0	The spy-music fetish and dubbed-out paranoia of the band's first two albums are traded in for earthy Stax soul and sprightly disco funk, along with plenty of turntable wobbles, wah-wah scratches and analog squiggles...
Limits of Desire	Small Black	Pop/Rock	2013-05-14 00:00:00	Exclaim	60.0	The only trouble is that nearly every track captures the same sense of John Hughes-worthy nostalgia, with no cut standing out above the rest.
Ratchet	Shamir	Electronic	2015-05-19 00:00:00	DIY Magazine	80.0	In a year that’s seen the heavyweights of the industry fannying about with abstract release plans and bickering over streaming services, Shamir has swept through and delivered a record that schools every one of them in the art of purest pop.
The Blade	Ashley Monroe	Country	2015-07-24 00:00:00	PopMatters	87.0	It’s less a question than a cry of pain. The Blade is full of them, and they sound splendid.
Eat Me, Drink Me	Marilyn Manson	Rock	2007-06-05 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	63.0	Mercifully, this album shouldn’t even be a footnote – it’s no nadir, for sure, but it sure isn’t any good.
Tramp	Sharon Van Etten	Pop/Rock	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Mojo	81.0	[A] very fine third album. [Mar 2012, p.98]
Life On Other Planets	Supergrass	Rock	2003-02-11 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	74.0	They're uneven, to be sure.... But Supergrass are never less than lovable. [14 Feb 2003, p.72]
Not Without A Fight	New Found Glory	Rock	2009-03-10 00:00:00	Spin	61.0	Not Without a Fight bobs and weaves between chugga-chugga riffs and poppy lead licks, with Jordan Pudnik's well-meaning whine bouncing off Chad Gilbert's more assertive (and appealing) bark.
Wounded Rhymes	Lykke Li	Pop/Rock	2011-03-01 00:00:00	Uncut	83.0	Her quirky homespun arrangements have been toughened and broadened, adding a knowingly retro girl-group stomp and echo-drenched Spector-ish grandeur to windswept heartbreak anthems. [Apr 2011, p.85]
Songs In A Minor	Alicia Keys	R&B;	2001-06-05 00:00:00	Q Magazine	78.0	Her aching sincerity&#8217;s another major plus; that she can get away with Caged Bird&#8217;s Stevie Wonder-isms and Fallin&#8217;s near plagiarism of James Brown&#8217;s It&#8217;s A Man&#8217;s World speaks volumes.
Two Dancers	Wild Beasts	Rock	2009-09-08 00:00:00	The Guardian	83.0	It's a strange state of affairs, a band that really come into their own when they background their greatest asset. But there's a lesson in there: sometimes, less is more.
R.I.P.	Actress	Electronic	2012-04-24 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	81.0	Now that the percussive elements are conspicuously absent, however, Actress requires a more thorough listen–and those that give it full attention will be rewarded with layers upon
Seth Avett and Jessica Lea Mayfield Sing Elliott Smith	Jessica Lea Mayfield	Folk	2015-03-17 00:00:00	Under The Radar	67.0	It's a stripped-down, heartfelt affair. [Apr-May 2015, p.80]
Ghost People	Martyn	Electronic	2011-10-10 00:00:00	AllMusic	76.0	The whole sternly focused thing is laced with enough emphasis on sound design to function as an immersive headphone listen, while at least two-thirds of it can drain one's energy on a dancefloor.
Bringing Back the Sunshine	Blake Shelton	Country	2014-09-30 00:00:00	PopMatters	62.0	Bringing Back the Sunshine is competent, but its sheer lack of variety, and over-reliance on trying to recapture the vibe of his previous effort sinks the album in a hurry. Best to label this one for die-hards only.
A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar	Dashboard Confessional	Rock	2003-08-12 00:00:00	Nick	77.0	i dont care what age you are... nothing beats dashboards energy that chris puts into very song he records.. best recording artist in the lasti dont care what age you are... nothing beats dashboards energy that chris puts into very song he records.. best recording artist in the last 10 years by far&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Venus	Joy Williams	Pop/Rock	2015-06-29 00:00:00	PopMatters	66.0	It feels like Williams is trying on a few different costumes to see what she likes, and only landing on material that feels natural maybe half the time. The good news is all of these songs are catchy and singable, and Williams strong vocal performance makes everything work even when a song doesn’t feel quite natural for her.
The Deep Field	Joan as Police Woman	Pop/Rock	2011-04-12 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	70.0	Even if, as a whole, The Deep Field isn't quite as rewarding as Wasser's first two records, it's an altogether different, diverse and challenging experience. Thankfully, that voice remains intact: vulnerable but somehow powerful.
American Beauty/American Psycho	Fall Out Boy	Pop/Rock	2015-01-20 00:00:00	DIY Magazine	72.0	At times the record may not hang together, but it makes up for that in its colour, its audacity, and its unabashed sense of pride at giving just about anything a go.
Real Life Is No Cool	Lindstrom & Christabelle	Electronic	2010-01-19 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	80.0	Once the shock of the new dissipates, what’s left is an impeccably assembled record worth indulging with the vigor that any of Lindstrom’s Christabelle-less work deserves.
Beach Fossils	Beach Fossils	Pop/Rock	2010-07-27 00:00:00	PopMatters	73.0	Payseur's vocals take on a uniform slack as this album rolls along. At first, it's an affecting choice, where we get to hear both his ennui and the fatigued relief he finds while escaping it. But as the record goes on, his delivery holds its monotone and, as a result, loses its effectiveness.
Electric President	Electric President	Electronic	2006-01-24 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	71.0	Not quite poppy and not quite moody, there's just not enough feeling in any direction to really make it stick.
Winning Days	The Vines	Rock	2004-03-23 00:00:00	Junkmedia	50.0	"The disc's highlight, ""TV Pro,"" ably blends the band's two moods and adds some promise to an otherwise bland and vacant offering."
Tripper	Fruit Bats	Pop/Rock	2011-08-02 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	74.0	Essentially, Tripper is not a drastic change for Fruit Bats but an homage to expansion and trying new things–while still knowing where home is.
At Mount Zoomer	Wolf Parade	Indie	2008-06-17 00:00:00	The Boston Phoenix	78.0	At Mount Zoomer will give you those same goosebumps you felt when you heard the band’s debut.
V	Live	Rock	2001-09-18 00:00:00	MarceloR	60.0	Well thought album!!!
Olympia	Bryan Ferry	Pop/Rock	2010-10-25 00:00:00	Uncut	72.0	Olympia could do with a little more of that future-facing yearning, the contemporary spirit that crackled through the remixes, to remind us of times when Ferry seemed as much a figure from our future as from our recent past. [Nov 2010, p.85]
Further	The Chemical Brothers	Electronic	2010-06-22 00:00:00	PopMatters	70.0	Unfortunately, with its endlessly recycled ideas, total lack of thematic unity, and surprisingly distracted sense of melody, Further only lives up to its title in the sense that the duo--despite their best efforts--continue to slowly moving away from what made them so great to begin with.
Movement	Holly Herndon	Electronic	2012-11-13 00:00:00	XLR8r	81.0	"Ultimately, the restless movement here doesn't help the ""classical"" tracks connect to a non-specialized audience, but it does make for an inventive dialogue between the club and the ivory tower."
Enemy Chorus	The Earlies	Indie	2007-01-23 00:00:00	Amazon.com	67.0	The 11 songs on their second album have their own separate identity, with a diversity of colors and influences putting the Earlies in the company of such contemporaries as Mercury Rev, the Polyphonic Spree, and even, occasionally, Beck.
I Bet on Sky	Dinosaur Jr.	Alternative/Indie Rock	2012-09-18 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	75.0	Their 10th album, I Bet on Sky, offers a shortcut through their solid, sonic history.
Cedars	Clearlake	Indie	2003-10-21 00:00:00	Playlouder	80.0	'Cedars' is a record of huge maturity - witty, often quite sad, occasionally perverse, but hugely charming nonetheless.
I Bet on Sky	Dinosaur Jr.	Alternative/Indie Rock	2012-09-18 00:00:00	Filter	75.0	It's Mascis plodding on, warbling apathetically and then suddenly breaking into his shimmering birdsong. What motivates the consummate slacker band to continue is beyond all of us. But is anyone complaining?
Red Gone Wild: Thee Album	Redman	Rap	2007-03-27 00:00:00	CalvinT	79.0	This is one of the best rap albums I have heard this year, Red puts it down on this cd, for it to recieve anything lower than an 80 rating is absurd.
Love Remains	How to Dress Well	R&B;	2010-10-19 00:00:00	AllMusic	81.0	Love Remains is a striking debut, one that speaks to how we listen to and remember music we love, and the impact it makes on everything else we hear.
Write Me Back	R. Kelly	R&B;	2012-06-26 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	73.0	Write Me Back isn't groundbreaking, even for Kelly, but the territory it does cover is glossy and confetti-strewn.
High Life	Brian Eno	Electronic	2014-07-01 00:00:00	Pitchfork	67.0	A startling and inspiring record. Eno’s been involved with quite a few of those in the past, but it’s especially nice to experience a new one that reaches us in the present moment.
Are You In?	De La Soul	Electronic	2009-04-28 00:00:00	PopMatters	71.0	Grab this if you need a solid work-out mix, but do not expect much more than that.
Parallel Play	Sloan	Rock	2008-06-10 00:00:00	Uncut	75.0	The follow-up--featuring a mere 13 songs--is solid and functional, but lacks that inspired edge. [Aug 2008, p.106]
Vespertine	Björk	Electronic	2001-08-28 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	88.0	This is breathtaking, life-affirming music with the power to heal and restore. It's that beautiful.
Russian Doll	Violet Indiana	Indie	2004-06-08 00:00:00	Splendid	57.0	Russian Doll is defined by beautiful tones, imprecise boundaries, world-weary subject matter and a Phil Spectorian sheen that obscures as much as it illuminates.
Out Of The Woods	Tracey Thorn	Indie	2007-03-20 00:00:00	Urb	76.0	This quirky little record shouldn't lose any old fans and may just gain her a few new ones. [Apr 2007, p.108]
The Red Light District	Ludacris	Rap	2004-12-07 00:00:00	Vibe	70.0	Subpar sonically... Red Light doesn't push toward something greater. [Feb 2005, p.138]
Rise Above	Dirty Projectors	Indie	2007-09-11 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	78.0	Alas, it's unlikely that the applause will stretch to actually wanting to listen as the looping metallic effects, heart-attack drums and seemingly played-backwards female vocals confuse more than impress.
18 Months	Calvin Harris	Pop	2012-10-30 00:00:00	Exclaim	57.0	18 Months has all the makings of a smash hit, but if you're looking for substance, you're better off looking elsewhere.
Meek Warrior	Akron/Family	Indie	2006-10-03 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	73.0	While the rawk portion of Meek Warrior... is a bit of a letdown, Akron/Family hasn't lost its knack for making pretty with the acoustics.
Antemasque	Antemasque	Pop/Rock	2014-11-10 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	67.0	For all of its bombast, the album’s last third fails to maintain much interest, especially the meandering “People Forget”, which sticks out in a group of otherwise tightly structured songs.
Join With Us	The Feeling	Rock	2008-02-18 00:00:00	The Guardian	66.0	Despite their confidence, the writing seems flat, which leads you to concentrate more on the gaudy settings than the songs.
Midnight Boom	The Kills	Indie	2008-03-18 00:00:00	Blender	75.0	The world's second-best co-ed lo-fi blues-rock duo are as sunny and merry as they've ever going to be, and that's not very sunny or merry. [Apr 2008, p.79]
Wolf	Tyler, The Creator	Rap	2013-04-02 00:00:00	Los Angeles Times	70.0	Tyler's Wolf may lack in editing and aural oomph, but it more than compensates with wit, if you can get past the way he seems to revel in tossing off invectives and then doubling back to defend them.
Comb the Feelings Through Your Hair	Grooms	Pop/Rock	2015-02-17 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	76.0	They’ve found a way to wedge different sonic elements together, creating an assemblage of oft-quoted elements that feels fresh and vital even when its tone turns elegiac.
Life For Rent	Dido	Pop	2003-09-30 00:00:00	Dot Music	69.0	Her bland-o-meter appears to be well and truly busted.
World Psychedelic Classics, Vol. 5: Who Is William Onyeabor?	William Onyeabor	R&B;	2013-10-29 00:00:00	AllMusic	82.0	Who Is William Onyeabor? may not answer many biographical questions, but it does paint a superb portrait of the musician as a highly original creator and pioneer; it adds depth and dimension to the picture we have of African music during the era.
Floreat	Mara Carlyle	Pop/Rock	2011-08-30 00:00:00	Mojo	86.0	Witty, touching, adored by everyone from Bjork to to Jon Snow; the wait is over. [Oct 2011, p.100]
Together	The New Pornographers	Rock	2010-05-04 00:00:00	Spin	71.0	The sharp riffs only occasionally add up to anything with a pulse, but the Pornos have always been bad mathematicians. Archaeology -- that's their subject.
Viva La Vida	Coldplay	Rock	2008-06-17 00:00:00	Sputnikmusic	72.0	Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends takes a band who should have been in decline and a sound that’s been tried and true and makes it all sound fantastically fresh.
Love Sign	Free Energy	Pop/Rock	2013-01-15 00:00:00	AllMusic	67.0	If you can get past that feeling and embrace the polished, shiny surfaces, and satin-jacketed AOR clichés, then Love Sign delivers a pleasing dose of nostalgic, good-time (almost) rock & roll.
I Was a Cat from a Book	James Yorkston	Pop/Rock	2012-08-13 00:00:00	Mojo	75.0	I Was a Cat from a Book is as warm as an all-enveloping blanket by the hearth. [Sep 2012, p.89]
Banga	Patti Smith	Pop/Rock	2012-06-05 00:00:00	Thecomposer102	81.0	"With some of the best songwriting of her career, Patti Smith makes a wonderful addition to her never ending list of achievements. Highlights:With some of the best songwriting of her career, Patti Smith makes a wonderful addition to her never ending list of achievements. Highlights: ""Amerigo"", for a perfect introduction to an album exploding with ideas.  Her cover of ""After the Gold Rush"" (however I disagree with her children joining in at the end, sounds over the top)""April Fool"", the best song on the record.

Bottle Rockets/The Brooklyn Side [Reissue]	The Bottle Rockets	Country	2013-11-19 00:00:00	AllMusic	89.0	This remains some of their finest work to date, and whether you missed them back in the day or are updating your library, this set is a must.
With The Tides	South	Indie	2003-09-23 00:00:00	Alternative Press	77.0	Though it has a couple great cuts that are in the running for Britpop song of the year, With The Tides lacks definition, making South more a group in the midst of a movement than one defining it. [Oct 2003, p.138]
Nextdoorland	The Soft Boys	Indie	2002-09-24 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	79.0	The psychedelic underpinnings of old are cleaned up a bit and the anger and bile that lay beneath the surface of the earlier material has been calmed, but there is still much to be enjoyed.
Once More 'Round the Sun	Mastodon	Pop/Rock	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Sputnikmusic	78.0	Filled to the brim with consistently excellent songs, Once More 'Round The Sun serves as a blueprint of how to go commercial without sacrificing one's artistic identity.
Infinite Dissolution	Locrian	Electronic	2015-07-24 00:00:00	The Quietus	83.0	It's a work that, while being their most accessible to date, is still dense enough to reward patience and repeated listens.

Built From Scratch	The X-Ecutioners	Rap	2002-01-29 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	62.0	With no new scratches, no innovations, and an abuse of mere battle scratches, the X-ecutioners overcompensate for their overall lack of creativity by cluttering tracks with constant restatements of reaffirmation, forcing even credible MCs to become pawns of the ornamental obsession to their own greatness.
For Emma, Forever Ago	Bon Iver	Indie	2008-02-19 00:00:00	Delusions of Adequacy	88.0	It’s seamless in its construction, poetic in its songwriting and moving in its aesthetic impression.
Audio, Video, Disco	Justice	Electronic	2011-10-24 00:00:00	Under The Radar	69.0	A game-changing debut like Cross is nearly impossible to follow up, but Audio, Video, Disco is about as self-assured as a second album gets.
Fears Trending	The Phantom Band	Pop/Rock	2015-01-26 00:00:00	AllMusic	76.0	As a companion album or on its own two legs, Fears Trending was worth another trip to well.
English Electric	Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark	Pop/Rock	2013-04-09 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	76.0	It’s powerful, emotive stuff--proof that electronic music can have soul, and that OMD’s soul is, so far, everlasting.
Shadows in the Night	Bob Dylan	Pop/Rock	2015-02-03 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	82.0	"The real treat in hearing Dylan rework tunes like ""Autumn Leaves"" is a slow-motion, humanistic view of how he finds the song's critical path."

Happiness Ltd.	Hot Hot Heat	Indie	2007-09-11 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	62.0	The trademark tempo jiggery remains and it's all threaded together with airy production that underlines rather than overwhelms.

Unfortunately, the same effort has not been put in all the other songs, that all miss originality in tune (except for Meet Virginia) and lyrics. Looks like the producer could not find the energy to raise the quality after he put in the effort for Drops of Jupiter. Hopefully, a more talented band will be inspired by the Drops.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;

Volume X	Trans Am	Pop/Rock	2014-05-20 00:00:00	Boston Globe	69.0	Trans Am has proven more complex than most critical reductions would suggest, and its 10th album plays like a highlight reel of the band’s best facets.
Songs In A Minor	Alicia Keys	R&B;	2001-06-05 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	78.0	A record of glorious parts that are just too weighty, too emotionally complex and rich to hang together well as a whole.
We All Belong	Dr. Dog	Indie	2007-02-27 00:00:00	The Boston Phoenix	73.0	Those vocal harmonies are used to good effect in the blue-eyed-soul tune 'Alaska.' But 'Die Die Die,' a slow and raggedy piece of psychedelia complete with funereal organ but thrown askew by out-of-place handclaps, is far too taken in by its own gloom.

I Love You, Honeybear	Father John Misty	Pop/Rock	2015-02-10 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	87.0	It’s the sort of album that even repeated listenings can throw up a myriad of surprises: you never really get to know who the character of Father John Misty is (is he a self-hating misogynist, is he a sage or is he just a simple romantic?), but it’s clear that Josh Tillman has slowly turned into one of the most talented songwriters of our age.
Hands of Glory	Andrew Bird	Pop/Rock	2012-10-30 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	74.0	While it's still a triumph of moody, Appalachia-drenched indie pop, Hands of Glory exists as merely a portion of a divided project that should have remained whole.
The Real Feel	Spiral Stairs	Indie	2009-10-20 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	57.0	Pavement fans expecting similar lo-fi experimentation may be disappointed with The Real Feel, but anyone who appreciates organically structured rock songs should love this album.
My Dinosaur Life	Motion City Soundtrack	Rock	2010-01-19 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	79.0	Instead of concerning themselves with matters out of their control, Motion City Soundtrack have knuckled down and at last knocked one out of the park.

Red Carpet Massacre	Duran Duran	Rock	2007-11-13 00:00:00	Billboard	61.0	Simon LeBon and company have a lot of baggage, and their latest effort doesn't match the neon-lit glory days of yesteryear.
Viva La Vida	Coldplay	Rock	2008-06-17 00:00:00	Boston Globe	72.0	Viva La Vida is just such an escape, a dreamy place to visit. And if it's not quite perfect, at least you get the sense that the members of Coldplay gave it their best shot.
The Invisible Way	Low	Pop/Rock	2013-03-19 00:00:00	Record Collector	80.0	Low still sound beautiful, but there’s a nagging feeling that The Invisible Way represents a slight drop-off in focus.

Utilizing heavy and interesting rhythms while using the lower register of the piano brings aThis album was Fiona coming into her real power.  Utilizing heavy and interesting rhythms while using the lower register of the piano brings a dark and, at the same time, funky feel to her music.  Her ballads shine even greater than they did on her first album as they move gently and make it difficult to shake the feeling of shear heartbreak.  I have not heard a female artist with lyrical craft nearly as great as Ms. Apple's.  Not only is this album a 10 out of 10, it ranks to be in my top 20 favorite albums of all time.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;

Yeezus	Kanye West	Rap	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Pitchfork	84.0	Each fluorescent strike of noise, incongruous tempo flip, and warped vocal is bolted into its right place across the record's fast 40 minutes.

Lightning Bolt contains the same 3 chord pattern the ENTIRE way through,Generic, simple rubbish is the only way to describe this album. Lightning Bolt contains the same 3 chord pattern the ENTIRE way through, symptomatic of an album and artist that is far more style over substance. Every song is a regressive, cliched and boring with no unique features to differentiate it to the 100's of other like it. Nearly every song's main writing credit is to a 40+ year old producer, and Bugg is signed to major label Mercury, putting pay to any notion of ""authenticity"". This perhaps explains the downright embarrassing lyricism on display here. ""Running from the feds"" is one among many the try-hard, faux authentic lyrics of this album, which can only be seen as a cynical ploy by Mercury to create an artist with ""street cred"". The accent he puts on is downright ridiculous, and makes him appear as a bad Bob Dylan impersonator. Jake Bugg? More like Fake Bugg.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"
A  Shut-In's Prayer	Advance Base	Pop/Rock	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Pitchfork	79.0	A Shut-In's Prayer is arguably the strongest album of Owen Ashworth's career thus far, and it arrives at a time when the influence of his former project looms over specific spheres of indie music.
Piñata	Madlib	Rap	2014-03-18 00:00:00	PopMatters	82.0	The truly impressive thing about Piñata is that when the album is at its top level, it’s nearly untouchable.
Bluefinger	Black Francis	Rock	2007-09-11 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	73.0	Black Francis' ability to explore familiar themes in a spastic, unfettered manner continues to remind us that uniqueness is not simply skin deep.

Solaris	Photek	Electronic	2000-09-19 00:00:00	Pitchfork	70.0	Solaris is an anthem for Eurotrash everywhere. Its sins are ultimately sloth and indifference. Eschewing the brilliantly cold futurism of earlier efforts, Photek has crafted a dull excursion into the sunnier latitudes of electronic music: a tropical cocktail of salt-rimmed drum n' bass, faux-sexual bedroom ambient and lifeless house.

The Grind Date	De La Soul	Rap	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Neumu.net	80.0	By corralling five hungry producers with a flair for the earthy funk and slippery samples that guided some of De La's best albums, the veteran trio have recorded the true successor to 1996's Stakes Is High.
Life is Good	Nas	Rap	2012-07-17 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	81.0	At times, Life is Good is Nas' most satisfying album since God's Son, and at times it is just as flawed as its predecessors.
Cornershop & the Double-O Groove Of	Cornershop	Pop/Rock	2011-03-15 00:00:00	Uncut	78.0	It fuses disparate cultures with such joyous irreverence that, for 40 inspirational minutes, entire notions of national borders and racial divides cease to exist. [Apr 2011, p.77]
It's a Wonderful Life	Sparklehorse	Rock	2001-08-28 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	81.0	Musing, eerie and oddly lovely, It's a Wonderful Life is almost minimalist - it captures fleeting moments in a few chords and peculiarly evocative phrases.
Ratworld	Menace Beach	Pop/Rock	2015-01-27 00:00:00	DIY Magazine	68.0	Ratworld is that rarest of beasts--a debut album that’s got a backstory running deeper than all six seasons of Lost, but still sounds like it’s delivered without any requirement for effort whatsoever.

Academy Songs, Vol. 1	Holopaw	Pop/Rock	2013-01-15 00:00:00	AllMusic	66.0	The themes are vague enough that they could be applied to any number of relationships or situations, and far more captivating are the arrangements and dynamic shifts in orchestrations that make up the cyclical nature of the album.
The 2nd Law	Muse	Alternative/Indie Rock	2012-10-02 00:00:00	Kerrang!	70.0	Does this all meld together into the cohesive whole of a perfect album? Well, no, not really. But does The 2nd Law represent a band whose only limitations seem to be the high ceiling of their collective imagination? The answer here is an emphatic yes. [6 Oct 2012, p.52]
Ancient Melodies Of The Future	Built To Spill	Indie	2001-07-10 00:00:00	Almost Cool	80.0	For most other groups, it would be a winner, but for Built To Spill it's a slight comedown from their stellar streak.
There Is Only Now	Souls of Mischief	Rap	2014-08-19 00:00:00	Q Magazine	84.0	The dense plot might be confounding on first listen but the MC's high-speed interplay and Younge's cinematic arrangements, recorded entirely live and analogue, make for a breathlessly entertaining masterclass in classic hip-hop storytelling.

Take Back The Universe (And Give Me Yesterday)	Creeper Lagoon	Rock	2001-04-17 00:00:00	Nude As The News	71.0	The material is maddeningly inconsistent, sometimes in the course of the same song.

From the Hills Below the City	Houndmouth	Country	2013-06-04 00:00:00	AllMusic	65.0	"The by-the-numbers production goes hand in hand with the bandmembers' tailored playing and thickly stylized vocals, hitting all the marks of emphatic country-enamored rock on tracks like the Toupin-fronted ""Houston Train,"" a tale of being strung out, riding the hard-luck rails."
Invisible Life	Helado Negro	Pop/Rock	2013-03-05 00:00:00	AllMusic	77.0	Invisible Life reaffirms that Lange can keep that quality, regardless of which direction he takes Helado Negro in next.

Is Is [EP]	Yeah Yeah Yeahs	Indie	2007-07-24 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	78.0	It is the band’s frontwoman whose personality is carried in the weight of this release--delicately cryptic lyrics screamed with a force that betrays the fact they're either complete trash or wilfully personal.
Cape Dory	Tennis	Pop/Rock	2011-01-18 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	76.0	This is a high-personality disc, one that avoids cliches and cheese while also being steeped in tradition and an immense dose of adorableness.
Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World	Original Soundtrack	Rock	2010-08-10 00:00:00	PopMatters	68.0	In the context of the movie almost all of these songs are great. But as a soundtrack album, Scott Pilgrim doesn't reach the same greatness.
Chemical Chords	Stereolab	Indie	2008-08-19 00:00:00	DavidF	72.0	This is a real treat, and easily their best since EMPEROR TOMATO KETCHUP - if not their best ever.
Von	Sigur Rós	Indie	2004-10-26 00:00:00	Pitchfork	68.0	Young, earnest, eerie, and overzealous, Von is a unique, almost belligerently unaffiliated piece of music that unsubtly blazons its idiosyncrasies.
Nightingale Floors	Rogue Wave	Pop/Rock	2013-06-04 00:00:00	Blurt Magazine	66.0	The impotence of railing against it is a theme running through a lot of the record, and in the case of Nightingale Floors, coming to terms with the past has freed Rogue Wave to turn in what might be their finest work.
Panic of Looking [EP]	Brian Eno	Electronic	2011-11-08 00:00:00	AllMusic	64.0	In all, it represents a beautiful set of ambience from one of the form's masters.
Dissed and Dismissed	Tony Molina	Pop/Rock	2014-03-25 00:00:00	AllMusic	79.0	Dissed is the kind of record that feels like it came out of nowhere to blow minds, and even though you can trace it clearly when you check out his previous work with the band Ovens or early solo recordings, it trumpets Molina's arrival with 12 short blasts of perfection.
The Physical World	Death from Above 1979	Pop/Rock	2014-09-09 00:00:00	PopMatters	75.0	As it stands, it’s still one of the year’s finest and worth the wait.
Hospitality	Hospitality	Pop/Rock	2012-01-31 00:00:00	The Boston Phoenix	75.0	Regardless of their ability to stand out in a crowd, they write tunes sharper than a thumbtack, with words that ramble around in fascinating stream-of-consciousness webs.

Total	SebastiAn	Electronic	2011-07-05 00:00:00	Expert Witness (MSN Music)	66.0	Committed to synth squelch and chary of synth tweedle, it's basically instrumental except when transforming Mayer Hawthorne into the generic soul falsetto he was born to be and M.I.A. into the cheeky disco dolly she's too conscious to become.
Youth & Young Manhood	Kings of Leon	Rock	2003-08-19 00:00:00	ShakingThrough.net	79.0	And not unlike the uncertain characters populating their songs, the band members  have yet to stake out a distinctive musical identity, borrowing a little too liberally from their Southern Rock roots without adding anything original to the mythology.

As I Am	Alicia Keys	R&B;	2007-11-13 00:00:00	AllMusic	66.0	And so even though As I Am is a flawed work--a little too poppy, a little too clichéd--it is also indicative of what Keys can and will do, and that she is someone, thanks to her curiosity, intelligence, and natural talent, who will be able to mature and grow for years to come
Red	Guillemots	Indie	2008-03-24 00:00:00	Pitchfork	60.0	Guillemots cram themselves into awkward fits, and Dangerfield has to squeeze the hardest--whether he's tying himself to a straightforward ballad instead of clamoring for the rooftops, or standing up for a fight when he's so much more comfortable slipping into a dream.
In Your Honor	Foo Fighters	Rock	2005-06-14 00:00:00	Uncut	70.0	Unquestionably the work of a band with ambitions rekindled. [Jul 2005, p.92]

To Pimp A Butterfly	Kendrick Lamar	Rap	2015-03-16 00:00:00	Spin	96.0	Lstenability is the difference between the majesty of this 79-minute behemoth on paper, and the songs it needs to succeed. So let's give it up to the astounding thicket of music here, the best-produced rap since the dawn of Drake.
Satan's Circus	Death in Vegas	Electronic	2005-05-24 00:00:00	Q Magazine	63.0	A diverting synthesis of analogue old-schoolery and modern genre-hopping. [Nov 2004, p.117]

Blank Project	Neneh Cherry	Electronic	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Pretty Much Amazing	82.0	Blank Project never aims for luxuriance. Neneh Cherry instead undertakes-- and nails--a riskier feat: a reflection on midlife that sounds both wise and inventive.
Forgiven	Los Lonely Boys	Rock	2008-07-01 00:00:00	Blender	55.0	Its penitent but hopeful mood still suggests a Catholic equivalent of corporate Christian rock
Paul's Tomb: A Triumph	Frog Eyes	Indie	2010-04-27 00:00:00	PopMatters	80.0	If Paul’s Tomb: A Triumph is not their best album, it’s certainly a close second (Tears of the Valedictorian remains their high-water mark for me). However, I do feel confident calling Paul’s Tomb the band’s most cohesive and expansive LP.
Narrow Stairs	Death Cab for Cutie	Indie	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	73.0	Narrow Stairs finds Gibbard more than willing to play to type, offering the same staid character sketches he’s used since his first EP and songs that reiterate his point, that, like, love can be rough on you.
The Sea	Corinne Bailey Rae	R&B;	2010-01-26 00:00:00	Dot Music	78.0	The leap in quality is clear from the album's opening bars.
Birthdays	Keaton Henson	Pop/Rock	2013-04-09 00:00:00	PopMatters	73.0	Birthdays is the kind of record you’re not likely to let go of easily and in coming times it’s likely to be a touchstone recording for a number of singer-songwriters and a measuring stick for critics.
Recorrupted [EP]	Whitechapel	Pop/Rock	2011-11-07 00:00:00	Alternative Press	48.0	Recorrupted's five tracks make for a solid stopgap release.

Different Gear, Still Speeding	Beady Eye	Pop/Rock	2011-03-01 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	65.0	Different Gear, Still Speeding is rife with the catchy, strum-intensive songs and nasal John Lennon impression the band was first known for.
Kingdom Of Rust	Doves	Indie	2009-04-07 00:00:00	Observer Music Monthly	77.0	Previous albums never quite lived up to the band's facility for knockout singles, but this one holds the attention.

Skylar Grey has a beautiful voice and this album allows her to show that off as a lead artist rather than as a feature.

Who Kill	tUnE-yArDs	Pop/Rock	2011-04-19 00:00:00	Pitchfork	86.0	This unguarded, individualistic expression encourages strong identification in listeners, so don't be surprised if this record earns Garbus a very earnest and intense cult following.
Everything Ever Written	Idlewild	Pop/Rock	2015-02-16 00:00:00	Tokyochuchu	77.0	Everything Ever Written is an unbelievable and unexpected return to form for Idlewild. That's probably a gross understatement, as EEW mightEverything Ever Written is an unbelievable and unexpected return to form for Idlewild. That's probably a gross understatement, as EEW might actually be the band's best album to date. The level of ambition and sonic texture found on this LP is far superior to anything the band has released prior. The way the songs flow and build into an atmospheric, cohesive experience is really quite masterful. Yet on the flipside, this record also collects up the many different eras of Idlewild into one package. 'On Another Planet' takes care of the brash punk of Hope is Important and A Hundred Broken Windows. 'Radium Girl' is pure The Remote Part style mainstream pop. 'Nothing I Can Do About It' and 'Like A Clown' could have easily found a home on Warnings / Promises. 'Collect Yourself' sounds like it comes directly from Make Another World and 'Come On Ghost' is the best single that Post Electric Blues never had. More than the sum of it's parts, sounding fresher than ever but somehow recalling the band's best moments, Idlewild's Everything Ever Written is a fantastic record.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Somewhere Else	Lydia Loveless	Pop/Rock	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Magnet	81.0	These songs, as punchy as ever, don't lean quite so heavily on unhinged, whiskey-soaked abandon. [No. 107, p.57]
Electric Arguments	The Fireman	Rock	2008-11-25 00:00:00	Under The Radar	74.0	Electric isn’t the most exciting album of the year, but it’s the most exciting McCartney effort in years. [Winter 2009]
Perfect View	Lust for Youth	Pop/Rock	2013-06-11 00:00:00	Pitchfork	68.0	His is the ambient music of someone else's party, happening far away from where you are, and the distance is part of the allure.
Apex Predator - Easy Meat	Napalm Death	Pop/Rock	2015-01-27 00:00:00	Pitchfork	89.0	It’s still a Napalm Death record through and through--which means shredded eardrums and tinnitus for days. After all this time, we’d expect nothing less.
Everything Ecstatic	Four Tet	Electronic	2005-05-31 00:00:00	Pitchfork	77.0	Everything Ecstatic marks his first slight step backward as a solo artist but it's hardly a failure.
Team Boo	Mates of State	Indie	2003-09-16 00:00:00	PopMatters	70.0	Hooks so catchy, voices so belty, organ so loud and . . . organy -- the whole experience overwhelmed my ears and hurt my brain. Listen at your own risk.
Motion	Calvin Harris	Pop	2014-11-04 00:00:00	Boston Globe	57.0	Most of the drops on the 15-track disc disappoint; too many songs never truly take off.
Hold It In	Melvins	Pop/Rock	2014-10-14 00:00:00	Classic Rock Magazine	74.0	Since 1983, The Melvins have been a wonderfully unstable constant on the rock fringes. Still fronted by Buzz Osborne of the explosion-in-a-mattress-factory hairdo, they continue to make good on that paradox with Hold It In. [Jan 2015, p.116]
Keep It Hid	Dan Auerbach	Rock	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Hartford Courant	80.0	Auerbach shows his vocal range again and again, actually singing instead of just howling at the moon, and his knack for warm production is impressive.
Post-Nothing	Japandroids	Indie	2009-08-04 00:00:00	No Ripcord	82.0	Regardless of classification, Japandroids have created something pure, something without pretense and without any concern for how smart or cool they will sound.
Jungle Revolution	Congo Natty	Electronic	2013-07-09 00:00:00	The Wire	72.0	Congo Natty always brings confrontational or cultural elements to set the context of the tracks. [Jun 2013, p.48]
Acoustic at the Ryman [Live]	Band of Horses	Pop/Rock	2014-02-11 00:00:00	The Line of Best Fit	66.0	Performing at a venue that once hosted the iconic long-running Grand Ole Opry show, the band do seem slightly in awe of their venerable surroundings. They certainly never get too chatty here, with Bridwell limiting himself to an occasional aww-shucks ‘Thanks y’all!’ or similar.
Wenu Wenu	Omar Souleyman	Electronic	2013-10-22 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	79.0	With lyrics in the languages of Turkey, Kurdistan and Iraq all included, with the express aim of engaging listeners throughout the region, Souleyman’s mission to bring a more positive view of his country, and its thrilling musical forms, to a wider audience continues unabated.
Last Exit	Junior Boys	Indie	2004-09-21 00:00:00	Dot Music	89.0	This is music that sounds like it was plotted by sad psychics graduates in lab coats. It's clean, melancholic and sterile (in a totally non-derogatory sense) - full of gently undulating rhythms and melodic pulses.

The  Runaway	The Magic Numbers	Pop/Rock	2010-07-23 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	50.0	The Runaway may just be a stumble on the band's road to maturity, but it could also signal something more troubling: the beginning of an endless, effortless loop.
Meet Glen Campbell	Glen Campbell	Country	2008-08-19 00:00:00	PopMatters	70.0	Campbell doesn’t reinvent any of them, but he was never really an inventor. What he does is make a fine, if not spectacular, album that mostly plays to his strengths.
Everything Wrong Is Imaginary	Lilys	Indie	2006-02-21 00:00:00	JeremyM	75.0	one of the best albums i&#039;ve ever heard. turns My Bloody Valentine into a mutated George Clinton and back again on a dime.

Back To Land	Wooden Shjips	Pop/Rock	2013-11-12 00:00:00	PopMatters	72.0	It might not be the album you were expecting at all, but it’s certainly one that proves Wooden Shjips’ free spirit still reigns.
Transference	Spoon	Indie	2010-01-19 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	80.0	Transference is the victim of an unfortunate irony--the more honed, the less it cuts.
Confess	Twin Shadow	Pop/Rock	2012-07-10 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	76.0	At its core this is brilliantly slick, dapper rock-pop.
Dream.Zone.Achieve	Smoke DZA	Rap	2014-04-01 00:00:00	PopMatters	63.0	It’s paint-by-numbers Harlem rap from the Jim Jones era, and frankly, in 2014 there’s just too much going on in hip hop for this to carry much sway, leaving Dream.Zone.Achieve a too-long-by-half 80-minute course in hard-nosed Harlem rap with plenty of good beats but without a distinct voice to guide it.
If Not Now, When?	Incubus	Pop/Rock	2011-07-12 00:00:00	TunaFish	48.0	"Several fans may have been disappointed, but let's face it, the SCIENCE and Make yourself days are over a decade in the past. In a way, I'mSeveral fans may have been disappointed, but let's face it, the SCIENCE and Make yourself days are over a decade in the past. In a way, I'm kinda glad the band did this. It was a surprise nonetheless, but its a surprise that grows on you. Every song has this kind of magic to it that usually kicks in after the second or third listen, but never the first. That is why you have to let it grow on you. Personally I think some of the tracks in this album are some of the band's most creative material. Tracks 7-10 stood out to me the most. The jovial acoustic melody of ""Defiance"", the length and bipolarity of ""In the Company of Wolves"", the upbeat tempo of ""Switchblade"", and the stunning atmosphere of ""Adolescents"" is what truly made this a great listening experience for me, and a factor to still appreciate this band for everything it has to offer.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"
Phantom Planet	Phantom Planet	Rock	2004-01-06 00:00:00	Q Magazine	66.0	This is as cynical a mish-mash of popular trends as you can imagine. [May 2004, p.106]
Doris	Earl Sweatshirt	Rap	2013-08-20 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	82.0	Though the narratives are harder to follow, and the refrains more verbose (or simply absent), this music is still full of youthful anger. The nature of it is simply more suitable for a recent-high-school-graduate-aged kid grappling with more knotty insecurities. It’s also probable that much of Earl’s younger audience has grown up with him, and will relate to this impressive record even more deeply than his first.
The Abandoned Lullaby	Icebird	R&B;	2011-10-11 00:00:00	HipHopDX	69.0	Unquestionably, this is one of the most complete works of music made this year, and absolutely speaks volumes about what cohesiveness and attention to detail can do for a project.
OST	Almost Famous	Rock	2000-09-12 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	70.0	Most soundtracks are compilations of the obvious... Almost Famous is the grand exception, avoiding easy choices while meticulously re-creating the feeling of being young, awkward, and in love with music in the early '70s.
Singer's Grave/A Sea of Tongues	"Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy"	Pop/Rock	2014-09-23 00:00:00	AllMusic	74.0	"Oldham’s intentions behind re-recording these relatively recent songs are puzzling, but the curious nature of the album is just another chapter of the mysterious, and in this case highly enjoyable saga of Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy."
You Have No Idea What You're Getting Yourself Into	Does It Offend You, Yeah?	Indie	2008-04-15 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	59.0	A shame, really, since there are couple of songs here displaying a melodic facility far in excess of the record’s dumbed-down intent.
The Chair In The Doorway	Living Colour	Rock	2009-09-15 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	68.0	Reid's playing is a thrill throughout; his solos sound like a mind blown wide but never to pieces.
Goodbye Yellow Brick Road [40th Anniversary Edition]	Elton John	Pop	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Clash Music	92.0	A glittering glam-pop bounty of androgynous pop bots, dock prostitutes, Depression-era outlaws, cowboys and nun-baiting schoolgirls, GYBR remains a vital and versatile vision of brilliance that deserves to be heard.
Ultramarine	Young Galaxy	Pop/Rock	2013-04-23 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	76.0	The lyrics are earnest as all hell, but only once--on Hard To Tell--borderline twee.
Danger in the Club	Palma Violets	Pop/Rock	2015-05-04 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	64.0	Danger In The Club exudes an appealing spontaneity but frustratingly the songwriting still seems a bit haphazard, with the lyrics in particular remaining underwhelming.

The Uglysuit	The Uglysuit	Indie	2008-08-19 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	69.0	The net result of The Uglysuit’s formula sounds something like an imagined pairing of Bedhead and Phish. It’s all right as far as it goes.
Tomorrow Right Now	Beans	Electronic	2003-03-11 00:00:00	Q Magazine	73.0	Feels oddly half-baked. [Apr 2003, p.100]
Tales From Turnpike House	Saint Etienne	Indie	2006-01-24 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	79.0	Succinct, tiny pop gems like 'Milk Bottle Symphony' and 'Relocate' are beautifully realised. [11 Jun 2005, p.67]
Porcelain	Sparta	Indie	2004-07-13 00:00:00	Neumu.net	62.0	"This is intense, serious music for serious times, and writing off Sparta as the ""other,"" less interesting half of their previous group would be a major mistake."
Fragrant World	Yeasayer	Pop/Rock	2012-08-21 00:00:00	PopMatters	71.0	"Fragrant World is an uglier, darker affair [than Odd Blood], full of tangled synth lines and hyper-compressed rhythm tracks. It's sometimes brilliant, too, with at least two hooky standouts (""Henrietta"", ""Reagan's Skeleton"") – but it's also the first Yeasayer album that threatens to collapse under its own teeming weight."
Eyes Open	Snow Patrol	Rock	2006-05-09 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	67.0	"To sum them up in one word, ""reliable"" would be the most appropriate."

Blood, Looms, And Blooms	Leila	Electronic	2008-07-08 00:00:00	Mojo	73.0	Though she occasionally loses focus Leila mostly pulls off this ambitious album and ends on a high note with 'Why Should I?' [Aug 2008, p.106]
Fear Is On Our Side	I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness	Indie	2006-03-07 00:00:00	Uncut	73.0	It's sleek, goth-leaning alt.pop, but ILYBICD's music ultimately leaves less of an impression than their band name. [May 2006, p.109]
No More Drama	Mary J. Blige	Pop	2001-08-28 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	77.0	At first, she sounds almost tepid in comparison to her older work, but this is music that grows in depth and feeling with each listen.

Rex The Dog Show	Rex The Dog	Electronic	2008-09-08 00:00:00	Pitchfork	65.0	It feels like exactly what it is: a slipshod collection of songs constructed intermittently, in broad strokes, over a period of years.
From Out Here	Advisory Circle	Electronic	2014-12-05 00:00:00	Record Collector	77.0	Brooks, though, stands out by dint of a nimble melodic touch, compositional sophistication and a broader historical frame of references. This makes From Out Here both satisfying and hard to pin down.
Sounds Of The Universe	Depeche Mode	Electronic	2009-04-21 00:00:00	The New York Times	70.0	Even at its most imaginative, this is seamless Depeche Mode filler, music that could be made by any number of acolytes.

Mines	Menomena	Pop/Rock	2010-07-27 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	74.0	Mines is thoroughly what one has come to expect from Menomena: an album that is titanic in scope, filled with offbeat wordplay, and entangled instruments.

Tha Carter III	Lil Wayne	Rap	2008-06-10 00:00:00	PopMatters	84.0	Tha Carter III is a monumental album full of powerful, self-defeating statements that obliterate rap’s internal logic without offering too much more than indifferent bong logic in return. Judged, however, as a collection of singles and quotable verses--the criteria on which we’ve been grading hip-hop records since the end of disco--Tha Carter III is an agonizing piece of work.

It's a solid summery pop song with infectious melodies & the good kind of “party lyrics”; as in the kind that makes you feel good inside rather than the kind that makes you wanna take 20 showers in a row In order to feel clean again.  Unfortunately though, with a few exceptions I'll get into later, this album as a whole is just dull & predictable.  All across this album are cliché rhymes (I'm talking girl/world level), extremely overproduced “epic” instrumentation & vocal lines, and sappy phoned-in lyrics about love, couples being in love, going through extremely vague hard times, etc.  And the latter might be justifiable if it was just on 1 or 2 tracks, but making it the theme of practically the whole album just plummets the believability level. There's a term I came up with to describe a good majority of the songs here, and that term is “chick flick rock”.  What I mean is that for nearly any track at any given point, it sounds tailor-made to appear in the last minute or so of the trailer for some corny chick flick, with “Bulletproofangel” being the most prime example of this.  The songs just show no personality in their genericness & sameness throughout, despite trying so desperately to tug at a few heartstrings, and the band ends up simultaneously sounding like the poor man's Switchfoot, the poor man's OneRepublic & the poor man's The Script combined into one entity of mediocrity.However that's not to say that every track is a failure.  The next one in the track list to get a positive response from me is “Bringing on the Light”, which while not too much better lyrically shows the band rocking out a bit like they did on most of A Boy Named Goo, which is refreshing.  Keep in mind that I'm the last one you'll see hating an album because it's different from their previous work, but without the rock element the Goo Goo Dolls' style for the most part is left pretty bland & uninteresting.  The song is also one of 2 to feature bassist Robby Takac on lead vocals, which with his rough nasally voice works much better here than on slow acoustic number “Happiest of Days”.  “Last Hot Night” combines a more detailed & well-written version of their “couple tales” with the fun celebratory attitude of “Rebel Beat” & a subtle working class social commentary theme.  And closer “Keep the Car Running” (which I was disappointed to learn wasn't an Arcade Fire cover) is also a solid track for similar reasons.  So overall, while this wasn't the worst or most disappointing album of 2013 that I've heard, I left it for the most part unsatisfied & wanting to take more from Magnetic than it had to offer.  I know these guys are talented songwriters, and it's not like any track here is downright unlistenable. They just need something to write about that involves less forced sincerity.Key tracks: Rebel Beat, Keep the Car Running, Bringing on the Light, Last Hot NightScore: 52/100&hellip;Full Review &raquo;

Club	73.0	Dark Night is a vocal showcase: Lynch, James Mercer of The Shins and Broken Bells, The Flaming Lips' Wayne Coyne, Iggy Pop, and several more stamp the tracks with appropriately brooding vocals. Only a few really stick, and not always in a good way.
Black Foliage: Animation Music	The Olivia Tremor Control	Indie	1999-03-23 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	75.0	Teasing the limits of pleasure and agony, 'Black Foliage' is a messy, irritating listen. But it's worth persevering just for those odd moments of gorgeousness.
Weezer (Red Album)	Weezer	Rock	2008-06-03 00:00:00	R	64.0	I get a kick out of the critics who first say a band is not stretching their limits or trying new or innovative sounds, only to complain whenI get a kick out of the critics who first say a band is not stretching their limits or trying new or innovative sounds, only to complain when they do.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Rites Of Uncovering	Arbouretum	Indie	2007-01-23 00:00:00	PopMatters	74.0	The CD has a freewheeling, anything-can-happen feel to it; even after you’ve listened to it more than once, it seems that the guitar solos could head off into any number of directions.
Sail Out [EP]	Jhené Aiko	R&B;	2013-11-11 00:00:00	HipHopDX	69.0	While Sail Out meets expectations of what Jhene fans have come to expect, it’s unlikely to convert doubters.
Guns Don't Kill People...Lazers Do	Major Lazer	Dance	2009-06-16 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	77.0	The large cast of vocalists are quite upfront in the mix, and the quality of the songs tends to depend on their talent, but for the most part it’s a strong collection of bangers, with few missteps.
Drastic Fantastic	KT Tunstall	Rock	2007-09-18 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	68.0	It's high-gloss folk pop, confessional in form if not in content, crafted with intelligent attention to every detail.
None Shall Pass	Aesop Rock	Rap	2007-08-28 00:00:00	Pitchfork	74.0	Beats-first, lyrics-second people have enough here to return to, and lyric freaks know there's plenty here to unpack.
Tasty	Kelis	Pop	2003-12-09 00:00:00	Mojo	80.0	Her voice is as irresistible as her songs. [Feb 2004, p.103]
Lonely Avenue	Nick Hornby	Pop/Rock	2010-09-28 00:00:00	Chicago Tribune	63.0	The pianist has a malleable voice, capable of swinging from poignance to sarcasm, though sometimes Hornby's dense wordplay can't help but sound awkward in making the transition from the page to the speakers.
Up To Now	Snow Patrol	Rock	2009-11-10 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	62.0	Hate them all you like, but Snow Patrol have some great songs and enough money now to forget all about the tripe they’re currently peddling at their massive group of new fans.
Futures	Jimmy Eat World	Rock	2004-10-19 00:00:00	Spin	73.0	"Jimmy Eat World might still be stuck in ""The Middle"" a year from now, but this album's more thoughtful homestretch at least suggests the possibility of alternate futures. [Nov 2004, p.115]"
Sports	Weekend	Pop/Rock	2010-11-09 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	76.0	Weekend has crafted an aesthetically sound model of how a rock 'n roll band should work. It looks good, it knows how to talk to women, and some guys you know even think it's pretty cool.
Both Lights	Au	Alternative/Indie Rock	2012-04-02 00:00:00	Exclaim	71.0	Both Lights fails to hold together because of its numerous failed lines of attack, which undermine the goodness.
In Light	Givers	Pop/Rock	2011-06-07 00:00:00	Sputnikmusic	70.0	In keeping with Givers' multi-dimensional aural assault, it only makes sense that vocals would also come from multiple sources. While drummer Kirby Campbell occasionally lends a hand, it is predominantly Guarisco and Lamson who brilliantly deliver the boy/girl dynamic on show here.
Outside Love	Pink Mountaintops	Indie	2009-05-05 00:00:00	Spin	75.0	Though McBean, who also leads Vancouver spliff-rockers Black Mountain, invites a slew of guests with diverse musical associations (Jackie-O Motherfucker, Thee Silver Mt. Zion, Whiskeytown), the album still yawns with homogeneous campfire acoustics.
Kill the Wolf	Matt Berry	Pop/Rock	2013-07-16 00:00:00	Uncut	71.0	Kill The Wolf is another ruralist fantasy furnished with tales of witchcraft and maypoles. [Aug 2013, p.67]
Boxer	The National	Indie	2007-05-22 00:00:00	Under The Radar	86.0	The record is slightly less New Wave-y than its predecessor with many of the tracks taking on a more organic polish. [#17, p.86]
Let There Be Morning	The Perishers	Indie	2005-04-12 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	65.0	The Perishers' second full-length album is, well, rather bland.
Spelled In Bones	Fruit Bats	Indie	2005-07-26 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	73.0	If you're willing to forgive a little lack of innovation and the subtle feeling that Spelled In Bones might be a little more mellow than it ought to be, there's one hell of a nice listen in this record.
Dylanesque	Bryan Ferry	Rock	2007-06-19 00:00:00	Filter	69.0	This is hardly some bog standard run-through of Dylan classics. [#25, p.102]
Shame, Shame	Dr. Dog	Rock	2010-04-06 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	77.0	Dr. Dog are a band you know you're going to appreciate as soon as you reach the first chorus. You'll want to go back and explore their back catalogue, and force them on unappreciative friends.
After Robots	BLK JKS	Indie	2009-09-08 00:00:00	Q Magazine	75.0	What sounds difficult at first unfurls with force over repeated listens, veering from the chant-driven 'Molalatladi' to 'Lakeside's' space rock reverie. [Oct 2009, p.108]
Give Up The Ghost	Brandi Carlile	Rock	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	81.0	It's her dynamic performances and some inspired collaborators who understand her strengths--in addition to Rubin, Elton John livens up 'Caroline' with some rollicking, ragtime-y piano licks--that make Carlile's Ghost a worthwhile effort.
In a Perfect World	Kodaline	Pop/Rock	2013-10-08 00:00:00	DIY Magazine	47.0	This is boy band material dressed up in an indie band’s clothes.
Swing Lo Magellan	Dirty Projectors	Pop/Rock	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Blurt Magazine	80.0	[Swing Lo Magellan] is instantly likeable. It makes perfect sense, but unravels into nonsense and complexity on second glance.
Reflektor	Arcade Fire	Pop/Rock	2013-10-29 00:00:00	The Quietus	80.0	Though a double album of 80 minutes, Reflektor feels shorter than The Suburbs, and better paced.
Niño Rojo	Devendra Banhart	Indie	2004-09-21 00:00:00	JamesN	82.0	Having recently bought the limited edition release of Nino Rojo and Rejoicing in the Hands i instantly fell in love with Devendra&#039;sHaving recently bought the limited edition release of Nino Rojo and Rejoicing in the Hands i instantly fell in love with Devendra&#039;s unusual vocal style. This is the better of the two in my opinion, the songs sound more emotional and heartfelt than on Rejoicing. Songs such as Sister and At The Hop stand out as particularly poinant, as Devendra&#039;s lyrics leave the land of fairytales and magic mushrooms and become much more personnal. The guitar playing is amazing, managing to be both simple and complex and although the use of chords can be repetitive, the varied melodies of the fingerpicking keep the music intersesting. Definately a must-buy.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Soldier Of Love	Sade	Pop	2010-02-09 00:00:00	Pitchfork	79.0	Soldier of Love offers listeners a rather narrow range of interest-- songs that (at their best) suggest strong feeling restrained by a fierce dignity-- but Sade remain the best at what they do.
March Of The Zapotec/Holland [EP]	Beirut	Indie	2009-02-17 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	71.0	To reiterate, then: it’s not the third Beirut album, like, proper. But as a means of sating collective appetites before that record does arrive--heightening expectations, even--it is a remarkable achievement.
Blackout	Britney Spears	Rock	2007-10-30 00:00:00	Dot Music	61.0	Blackout is business as usual. Courting publicity more shamelessly than that infamous kiss with Madonna, Britney writhes, moans and generally gives good pillow talk for the duration of an album where crunk, glitches, squeaks and clubbed-up beats dominate.
It Still Moves	My Morning Jacket	Indie	2003-09-09 00:00:00	Village Voice	83.0	The songs are still structured with minimal vocals and long repetitive jams, but they seem more crafted this time, not just meandering soundscapes.
Cupid Deluxe	Blood Orange	Pop/Rock	2013-11-19 00:00:00	The Quietus	75.0	Despite the transience, this is the most settled and mature his work has ever sounded. To put it another way, it's a look that suits, and you hope it sticks.
Sound & Color	Alabama Shakes	Pop/Rock	2015-04-21 00:00:00	Uncut	80.0	Disparate but cohesive. [May 2015, p.69]
Eskmo	Eskmo	Electronic	2010-10-19 00:00:00	Expert Witness (MSN Music)	66.0	Not terribly beaty and almost never fast. Just the kind of weird background music that's guaranteed to engross whenever you lend it both ears.
Chemistry Of Common Life	Fucked Up	Rock	2008-10-07 00:00:00	Dot Music	85.0	Whether forsaken or not, Fucked Up certainly do a fine job of making the political sound personal--a victory in itself when taken with a sonic ferocity so broad in its range and wide in scope.
Alter The Ending	Dashboard Confessional	Rock	2009-11-10 00:00:00	AllMusic	58.0	"Returning fans may take comfort in these cathartic anthems, but those who were won over by ""Poison Trees""--a return-to-form effort that combined melody with more nuanced arrangements--will prefer the deluxe edition's acoustic disc."
St. Catherine	Ducktails	Pop/Rock	2015-07-24 00:00:00	Pitchfork	73.0	This is Ducktails’ most discriminating and tasteful album, but the project is at its best when there's a certain amount of exploration even within its narrow parameters.
Easy Pain	Young Widows	Pop/Rock	2014-05-13 00:00:00	Alternative Press	82.0	Easy Pain reminds you how horrible the world can be, as well as the catharsis you can achieve if you'd only just immerse yourself in the maelstrom. [Jun 2014, p.111]
Frantic	Bryan Ferry	Rock	2002-05-21 00:00:00	Mojo	77.0	A pleasantly surprising step in the right direction. [May 2002, p.104]
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend	Miranda Lambert	Country	2007-05-01 00:00:00	Billboard	85.0	"Best-known for her flame-throwing hit ""Kerosene,"" Miranda Lambert delivers more of the same on her new album. [5 May 2007]"
Lily Perdida	Clue To Kalo	Electronic	2009-01-20 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	72.0	So, um, good? Yeah, but in the same way grilled cheese sandwiches are.
Exile	Hurts	Pop/Rock	2013-03-11 00:00:00	The Independent on Sunday (UK)	59.0	It's on close personal terms with magnificence.
What We Lose In The Fire We Gain In The Flood	The Mynabirds	Indie	2010-04-27 00:00:00	Lost At Sea	77.0	"Laura Burhenn just smolders over a piano-heavy groove. It really is as close to Dusty as they get, but what makes this record special is the way that even when the lyrics clunk up some of the smooth blue-eyed soul (opener and sort-of title track ""What We Gained in the Fire"" comes to mind), the production is so plainly gorgeous that it really feels like nitpicking (even if it really isn't)."
Rather Ripped	Sonic Youth	Rock	2006-06-13 00:00:00	ShakingThrough.net	82.0	Rather Ripped is a solid collection of songs smartly executed by a band secure in its legacy and refusing to go gently into that good rock night.
Islands	The Mary Onettes	Rock	2009-11-03 00:00:00	PopMatters	66.0	Catchy as it may be, Islands remains steadfast in the landscapes it portrays. The constraints of four-minute pop songs are defied with ease, weaving and stretching throughout said landscapes.
Distortion	REV RUN	Rap	2005-10-18 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	61.0	An awkward attempt that neither improves upon nor updates the trio's original blueprint. [28 Oct 2005, p.89]
Luxury Problems	Andy Stott	Electronic	2012-11-06 00:00:00	Boston Globe	86.0	Stott doesn't just produce these tracks, he haunts their halls.
Will Happiness Find Me?	Maria Minerva	Electronic	2012-09-04 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	77.0	The new LP from bright and bookish producer Maria Minerva (AKA Maria Juur), Will Happiness Find Me? is a surprising mosaic of deeply pained electronics paired with intense techniques, and a pop sensibility.
The  Best of Kylie Minogue	Kylie Minogue	Electronic	2012-06-19 00:00:00	AllMusic	75.0	This collection is proof that Kylie is arguably the best pop singer of her era and more importantly, is fun from beginning to end.
No Flashlight: Songs Of The Fulfilled Night	Mount Eerie	Indie	2005-08-16 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	72.0	With No Flashlight, Elvrum is shifting the focus of his music onto himself. It’s unclear whether this is the smartest move to make, in light of his obvious production mastery.
Feathers	Feathers	Indie	2006-04-11 00:00:00	Alternative Press	80.0	At times beautiful, at times shambling. [Jun 2006, p.194]
Party Store	The Dirtbombs	Pop/Rock	2011-02-01 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	70.0	The conceit of The Dirtbombs covering dance music is genius.
Wonderful, Glorious	Eels	Pop/Rock	2013-02-05 00:00:00	The Quietus	76.0	Intermittently enjoyable, Wonderful, Glorious is unmistakably the work of Eels but unlike previous and successful meditations, their tenth album frequently feels like well-honed schtick rather than a worthwhile insight.
Centipede Hz	Animal Collective	Pop/Rock	2012-09-04 00:00:00	Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM)	75.0	"Centipede Hz is dense and unforgivingly full-throttle--you'll find no ""Loch Raven"" or even ""Chores"" here – and home to some of the band's best and most involved lyrics to date."
Lysandre	Christopher Owens	Pop/Rock	2013-01-15 00:00:00	Spin	68.0	At just under a half-hour (a runtime probably inspired by the days when vinyl records could only contain about 40 minutes of music), Lysandre is a frustrating listen.

In The Absence Of Truth	Isis	Rock	2006-10-31 00:00:00	Delusions of Adequacy	70.0	Alas, it feels like In the Absence of Truth finds the band both spinning its wheels and running out of ideas.
Blurred Lines	Robin Thicke	R&B;	2013-07-30 00:00:00	trickybee	59.0	"A lot of these songs sound dated, but not in a fresh way. ""Feel Good"" sounds like Calvin Harris/Sam Sparro circa 2008.

The Pretty Toney Album	Ghostface Killah	Rap	2004-04-20 00:00:00	Mojo	84.0	Forget notions of old or new schools: this is an album that blends a kindergarten-level technique with styles that are strictly postgraduate. [Jun 2004, p.116]
Grinderman	Grinderman	Rock	2007-04-10 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	83.0	Grinderman isn’t angry and it isn’t raw, just a careful concoction of licentiousness and braying disdain ultimately monotonous and unexciting after the first four cuts.
Under Color of Official Right	Protomartyr	Pop/Rock	2014-04-08 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	83.0	The disjointed nature of Under Color’s thrust somehow catapults its enjoyability.

Chops	Euros Childs	Indie	2006-10-24 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	60.0	Sadly, he only briefly reaches the heights of his best Gorky's work. [18 Feb 2006, p.36]
The Stand Ins	Okkervil River	Indie	2008-09-09 00:00:00	Village Voice	78.0	"The Stand-Ins, reportedly taped at the same time as ""Stage Names,"" is an improvement, not least because Sheff punishes himself (rather humorously) for the sin of relying on tragic heroes at all."
That Don't Make Me A Bad Guy	Toby Keith	Country	2008-10-28 00:00:00	Hartford Courant	76.0	The 47-year-old Oklahoma native alters that repertoire somewhat with That Don't Make me a Bad Guy, sticking to accessible, down-home rock even as his singing ranges from new directions to bland drains on his natural character.
Hypnophobia	Jacco Gardner	Pop/Rock	2015-05-05 00:00:00	AllMusic	74.0	Despite these small tweaks to his established, well-oiled formula, Hypnophobia feels like a natural follow-up to Cabinet, with Gardner not looking to do much of anything new.
We Are Him	Angels Of Light	Indie	2007-08-28 00:00:00	AllMusic	77.0	Even in this mellowed state, Gira's still never going to be a majority taste, but Angels of Light come up with a thoroughly respectable and diversely arranged vehicles for his vision on We Are Him, traipsing through an array of interesting moods without diluting the leader's offbeat visions.
Join the Dots	TOY	Pop/Rock	2014-01-07 00:00:00	Delusions of Adequacy	71.0	There are a number of ear-worthy gems on the album but it’s difficult to muster up enthusiasm for a band that doesn’t seemingly have much enthusiasm themselves.
Smoke	White Williams	Indie	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Uncut	70.0	Williams' voice is weakly anonymous, Verlaine minus the venom. But his obsessive recreation of his heroes' studio tricks compensates. [Aug 2008, p.113]
Immunity	Jon Hopkins	Electronic	2013-06-04 00:00:00	Q Magazine	82.0	There's a substance and sense of space in these meditative moments that makes for a satisfying, deep listening experience. [Jul 2013, p.113]
Understated	Edwyn Collins	Pop/Rock	2013-03-25 00:00:00	DIY Magazine	77.0	Granted, even now it's difficult to assess his work wholly objectively given his recent, well-documented struggles, but strip away any unnecessary contextualisation and the record stands up proudly and defiantly on its own two feet.
English Graffiti	The Vaccines	Pop/Rock	2015-05-26 00:00:00	Q Magazine	73.0	By avoiding a quick fix, The Vaccines have made their most complete album yet. [Jun 2015, p.113]
Free Reign II	Clinic	Pop/Rock	2013-03-04 00:00:00	DIY Magazine	75.0	The whole thing would have sufficed as a bonus disc rather than the standalone album it is.
Pink	Four Tet	Electronic	2012-08-20 00:00:00	Sputnikmusic	79.0	For the die-hard Four Tet fan who jumps over every release the man has put out, Pink isn't really going to offer much outside of a rather flash piece of packaging that coincidentally happens to store all of his recent tunes in one convenient place. For others though, it's simply going to be another Four Tet release, which is a lot better than a whole lot from everyone else.
Man Overboard	Ian Hunter	Rock	2009-07-21 00:00:00	PopMatters	76.0	To hear a half-dozen sappy love songs from this notoriously poison pen, well, what the world needs now from Hunter is not love, sweet love.
The Big Roar	The Joy Formidable	Pop/Rock	2011-03-15 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	77.0	It's as good an introduction to the band as those 2008 singles were; sometimes thrilling, sometimes disappointing, but always formidable.
Player Player	Kpt.Michi.Gan	Electronic	2003-06-10 00:00:00	The Wire	79.0	Unlike a lot of electronica, the music never lapses into mere tastefulness. [#235, p.75]
Summer Make Good	Mum	Indie	2004-05-04 00:00:00	No Ripcord	71.0	This is not for all tastes. Slow, broody, experimental.

La Futura	ZZ Top	Pop/Rock	2012-09-11 00:00:00	Uncut	73.0	La Futura sounds at times overly relaxed, but never less than a fun, frill-free ride. [Dec 2012, p.79]
Rook	Shearwater	Indie	2008-06-03 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	85.0	While earlier albums hinted at the kind of open-air pastorals that the band was capable of, Rook delivers on all the promise.
Junk of the Heart	The Kooks	Pop/Rock	2011-09-13 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	54.0	There's just an unavoidable sense here of a band who aren't quite sure what their purpose is anymore.
Tomorrow Today	Seeland	Indie	2009-03-17 00:00:00	PopMatters	69.0	The few tracks where Seeland drop the ball reveal that their sound is dangerously amenable to turning into mere wallpaper, though. If they focus on sticking to the extremes of their pleasant palette Seeland might be on to something.
Ashes & Fire	Ryan Adams	Country	2011-10-11 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	76.0	Ashes & Fire might mark the first time he could ever been described as simply dull.

Skeleton	Abe Vigoda	Indie	2008-07-08 00:00:00	Pitchfork	83.0	Skeleton's flaws are few and often obscured by the album's mixing: Vidal's vocal adds an additional rhythmic layer, but his lyrical work is interesting enough to be more pronounced and less muddied.
Payola	Desaparecidos	Pop/Rock	2015-06-23 00:00:00	The Independent (UK)	76.0	Listening to Oberst’s righteous rage, his tone a world away from his tender confessionals, one has to credit his dedication, 14 years on, to making them heard.
VH1 Storytellers	Kanye West	Rap	2010-01-05 00:00:00	PopMatters	66.0	He may be the lead in the story he’s telling, but he’s always in the story; his VH1 Storytellers album powerfully reminds us that that is where he’s at his best.
13	Black Sabbath	Pop/Rock	2013-06-11 00:00:00	The Telegraph (UK)	72.0	With the hard-hitting yet loose-limbed playing of Rage Against the Machine drummer Brad Wilk, there is a real sense of top professionals at work.... Osbourne’s singing, by contrast, is strangely unexpressive, perhaps because there is no real possibility of emotional connection with lyrics that strain for grandiose effect but are flattened by clunking phrases and trite rhyming schemes.
Clear Heart Full Eyes	Craig Finn	Pop/Rock	2012-01-24 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	69.0	As a solo artist, Finn has created a new world of characters and songs that's rich enough on its own, and worth someday revisiting.

Release The Stars	Rufus Wainwright	Indie	2007-05-15 00:00:00	Under The Radar	72.0	Most of Stars ends up feeling like a sleight of hand; pay no attention to the lack of accessibility, but instead be distracted by the unecessarily grandiose 'I'm Not Ready to Love.' [Summer 2007, p.86]
Dragging A Dead Deer Up A Hill	Grouper	Rock	2008-06-10 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	80.0	Dragging a Dead Deer Up a Hill, can simultaneously be one of the most delicate, affecting albums of the year, and, yet, at the same time have such a strange, menacing name.
Mission Control	The Whigs	Indie	2008-01-22 00:00:00	Under The Radar	71.0	For people who enjoy overly polished, sub-par bar bands. [Winter 2008, p.89]
Maze	TrioVD	Jazz	2012-05-21 00:00:00	Mojo	74.0	There is less of the soundscaping and eerie atmospherics that made last year's X EP so entertainingly varied. [Jun 2012, p.85]
Halos & Horns	Dolly Parton	Country	2002-07-09 00:00:00	Delusions of Adequacy	73.0	The problem is, Parton seems hesitant to just go ahead and continue to make the kinds of albums that will attract hardcore folk and roots enthusiasts, instead tempering her material with apparent attempts to hold appeal to a wider audience. So, at best, the final results are a bit mixed.
Incubation	Function	Electronic	2013-03-05 00:00:00	XLR8r	84.0	"Disregarding the CD's tacked-on bonus cuts, what takes place between the record's two ""Voiceprint""s is a richly detailed, time-dilating set from a producer who can make the most out of narrow limitations."
This Modern Glitch	The Wombats	Pop/Rock	2011-04-26 00:00:00	No Ripcord	59.0	Apparently The Wombats only managed to write the one song for the album and so have decided to just repeat it ten times, offering little-to-no variation in tone or tempo--although to be fair to them, they do stick a different synth preset on for each song so you can tell them apart.
Below The Branches	Kelley Stoltz	Indie	2006-02-07 00:00:00	PopMatters	79.0	It’s not bad, and it’s not great. What it is, however, is Antique Glow Part II.  And that is a shame.
Copper Gone	Sage Francis	Rap	2014-06-03 00:00:00	The 405	64.0	It's cerebral, visceral storytelling. How you feel about that is your prerogative.
Chain Gang Of Love	The Raveonettes	Indie	2003-09-02 00:00:00	PopMatters	77.0	That Jesus and Mary Chain vibe is still there, but this time around, the focus is almost exclusively on just how catchy Wagner and Foo can make each song, and the result is surprisingly effective.
One By One	Foo Fighters	Rock	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Billboard	75.0	One by One, in all its thunderous angst and desperate expressions of hope, represents a full-on exploration of the Foos '70s influences.

Nights in the Dark	California X	Pop/Rock	2015-01-13 00:00:00	Exclaim	69.0	On Nights in the Dark, California X are comfortable in their own skin and playing at the peak of their powers, but the album would have fared best as a pared down EP nonetheless.
Hysterical	Clap Your Hands Say Yeah	Pop/Rock	2011-09-20 00:00:00	Under The Radar	69.0	"The album sags a bit in the middle, but such songs as ""Yesterday, Never"" and ""Ketamine and Ecstasy"" pick up the slack, chugging along with thumping drums and jangly guitars of early R.E.M. [Oct 2011, p.104]"
The Minimal Wave Tapes, Vol. 2	Various Artists	Electronic	2012-02-28 00:00:00	CMJ	73.0	The tracks are truly hidden gems, kept from mass appraisal via DIY distribution methods in the '80s, home-recorded cassettes and vinyl. Vasicka and Peanut Butter Wolf's efforts here revive and catalog some truly infectious would-be synth classics.
Currents	Tame Impala	Pop/Rock	2015-07-17 00:00:00	Chicago Tribune	84.0	Though still dense and detailed in a way that lives up to Parker's reputation as an obsessive studio hermit, Currents also feels more spacious and danceable in its finest moments.
Works for Tomorrow	Eleventh Dream Day	Pop/Rock	2015-07-24 00:00:00	Blurt Magazine	80.0	Eleventh Dream Day acknowledges its past and could fit in comfortably with the big dogs.
Anything In Return	Toro y Moi	Electronic	2013-01-22 00:00:00	The Observer (UK)	70.0	It has a youthful glow, but over 13 tracks Anything lacks substance.
Voxtrot	Voxtrot	Indie	2007-05-22 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	71.0	Voxtrot is a thoughtful, well-crafted pop record that doesn't live up to expectations and anticipation.
With Love And Squalor	We Are Scientists	Indie	2006-01-10 00:00:00	Pitchfork	67.0	"Most of these tracks have hooks aimed straight for your jugular, but ""Can't Lose"" shows the band could go even farther with a little restraint."
Scale	Matthew Herbert	Electronic	2006-05-30 00:00:00	BBC collective	81.0	Warm and quirky. Pleasantly bizarre. Sophisticated and daft. Herbert at his best.
Return To Cookie Mountain	TV on the Radio	Indie	2006-09-12 00:00:00	Playlouder	88.0	Fascinatingly dense, soulful and utterly divine.
No Color	The Dodos	Folk	2011-03-15 00:00:00	PopMatters	79.0	No Color wasn't meant to break any barriers: it's merely an affirmation of what people have known and loved about the duo for some time now.
Sad Songs For Dirty Lovers	The National	Indie	2003-09-02 00:00:00	Uncut	78.0	The musicianship lifts Sad Songs... even further into the realm of the extraordinary. [Dec 2003, p.133]
The King of Limbs	Radiohead	Pop/Rock	2011-03-29 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	80.0	Okay, so how do they still fare? With The King of Limbs, reasonably well.
American Beauty/American Psycho	Fall Out Boy	Pop/Rock	2015-01-20 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	72.0	"When everything connects--like on the single ""Centuries""--FOB are a glorious nexus of Seventies glitter rock, Eighties radio pop, Nineties R&B; and Aughts electro stomp. But the LP still runs the risk of being too cutesy and referential."
The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again	John Fogerty	Rock	2009-09-01 00:00:00	Billboard.com	68.0	"For this warm set of 11 country-time covers (including a track from his 1986 album, ""Eye of the Zombie""), Fogerty turns to his speed-dial list of superstars."
Ultravisitor	Squarepusher	Electronic	2004-03-09 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	74.0	Ultravisitor appears to be the first album when jazz can completely mesh with Squarepusher&#146;s canonized style.
OK Cowboy	Vitalic	Electronic	2006-02-21 00:00:00	Spin	82.0	While Vitalic may add little to electronic music or its various subgenres, he interweaves effortlessly their prevailing styles into complex arrangements that are neither kinked-up innovation nor neutered homage.
Dances in Dreams of the Known and Unknown	The Skull Defekts	Pop/Rock	2014-04-08 00:00:00	The Line of Best Fit	73.0	This band are masters of their craft, and Dances in Dreams of the Known and Unknown is simply more evidence to attest to that assertion.

Interpol	Interpol	Pop/Rock	2010-09-07 00:00:00	Filter	66.0	True, a few of these compositions will probably end up soundtracking your next funeral party; but there are hints of a band yearning to crawl out from under the weight of its own history.
23	Blonde Redhead	Indie	2007-04-10 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	83.0	It's a testament to their talent that by their seventh album they're still continuing to develop and reinvent themselves.

Blood	In This Moment	Pop/Rock	2012-08-14 00:00:00	SchroederRock	54.0	"In This Moment dig into a dark, sedistic metal teased with electronic filler to bring forth one of their more interesting works to date.In This Moment dig into a dark, sedistic metal teased with electronic filler to bring forth one of their more interesting works to date.  Several of the tracks feel purposeful and rarely boring or skip-worthy, such as the lead single ""Blood"" and the follow-up ""Adrenalize"".  The halfway point's ""Scarlet"" is one of the defining moments of the album, providing brooding acoustic guitars that eventually spill into the full band bashing the group is known for.  Overall the album is strong, though it's not the crowning achievement of the band's discography.  I can see where In This Moment could build off of Blood and craft one of the better metal albums in recent history.  The potential is definitely there.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"
Sees the Light	La Sera	Pop/Rock	2012-03-27 00:00:00	The Fly (UK)	74.0	It's slicker than anything Katy's done before – maybe not as long-term-lovable, but certainly worth living with for a while.
I Don't Like Shit: I Don't Go Outside	Earl Sweatshirt	Rap	2015-03-23 00:00:00	RapReviews.com	81.0	I Don't Like S#%! sees Earl continuing to mature and grow as an artist.
Kairos	White Hinterland	Rock	2010-03-09 00:00:00	PopMatters	76.0	Some of the pleasures of Kairos come from the grooves and the surfaces, which can be quite beautiful and lush. Yet just as often, the pleasures are in listening past those, being surprised to find how disarming the lyrics can sometimes be.
Brothers and Sisters of the Eternal Son	Damien Jurado	Pop/Rock	2014-01-21 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	79.0	Brothers and Sisters shows the songwriter at his most adventurous, aspiring for something bigger in a new direction.

Encyclopedia	The Drums	Pop/Rock	2014-09-23 00:00:00	Exclaim	61.0	Encyclopedia finds the Drums throwing everything at the wall, seeing what sticks, and then releasing the results as an album.
A City By The Light Divided	Thursday	Rock	2006-05-02 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	75.0	While the rest of the band have proven they can write solid music, it's singer Geoff Rickly who presents the biggest problem, and that's mostly because the man simply cannot tone down his over-emoting.
Road To Rouen	Supergrass	Rock	2005-09-27 00:00:00	Playlouder	73.0	Patchy, though when it's good (and nicked) it's very good.
June 2009	Toro y Moi	Pop/Rock	2012-04-24 00:00:00	DIY Magazine	66.0	For Toro y Moi enthusiasts, this will be nothing new, but for the rest of us 'June 2009' is an altogether pleasant blast from the recent past.
Girl Talk	Kate Nash	Pop/Rock	2013-03-05 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	63.0	there are occasions on Girl Talk when we get glimpses of what another, better Kate Nash indie rock album would have sounded like.... Unfortunately, moments such as these are the exception, not the rule, on Girl Talk.
Life Fantastic	Man Man	Pop/Rock	2011-05-10 00:00:00	CMJ	77.0	Man Man has an image to uphold, and it does that while refining its focus. The group has moved forward conceptually but at times still sounds like the trained animals and clowns from the circus that ambushed the orchestral pit, and that's just fine.

Gamel	OOIOO	Pop/Rock	2014-07-01 00:00:00	The Independent on Sunday (UK)	77.0	It takes a few plays to acclimatise to but, once won over, whatever you listen to next will seem pedestrian by comparison. Lovely, but wholly on its own terms.
Ten [Reissue]	Pearl Jam	Rock	2009-03-24 00:00:00	Uncut	84.0	There is much, meanwhile, to recommend the O’Brien remix, or “deconstruction” as he puts it. What O’Brien has mostly done is strip away the more ornate layers of the Palmer mix and cutting back on the album’s moments of more florid melodrama.
One	Dirty Vegas	Rock	2004-11-30 00:00:00	Filter	35.0	One is a kinder, gentler record and I mean that in the worst possible way. [#14, p.98]
Living On The Other Side	The Donkeys	Indie	2008-09-09 00:00:00	Uncut	67.0	All elements are delivered with an easy, effortless roll--you suspect The Donkeys may turn out to be lions. [Oct 2008, p.83]
Idealism	Digitalism	Electronic	2007-06-19 00:00:00	Under The Radar	77.0	It's the subtlest distortion-heavy dance-pop album of the year, which makes it less compelling than its contemporaries, but also might make it more enduring. [Summer 2007, p.87]
Baby	Tribes	Pop/Rock	2012-03-13 00:00:00	Clash Music	62.0	An impressive debut.
Sound Loaded	Ricky Martin	Pop	2000-11-14 00:00:00	Billboard	64.0	"""Sound Loaded"" shows Martin walking the tightrope between requisite familiarity and fresh musical ground with remarkable ease."
We're Animals	Numbers	Indie	2005-09-13 00:00:00	Lost At Sea	73.0	Numbers tout themselves as a dance-punk outfit, but they won’t get you on the dance floor anytime soon.
The Winter Of Mixed Drinks	Frightened Rabbit	Indie	2010-03-09 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	78.0	Frightened Rabbit wrings a winning simplicity from all this august isolation. A cardiac pulse animates many of the songs, a mightily thwacking unison at the core of all the kaleidoscopic embellishment.
Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes	Social Distortion	Pop/Rock	2011-01-18 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	71.0	It might not end up being one of the best albums of 2011, but it's still worth your time (and it was certainly worth six years to Ness).
"The ""W"""	Wu-Tang Clan	Rap	2000-11-21 00:00:00	AllMusic	80.0	While the trademark sound is still much in force, group mastermind RZA jettisoned the elaborate beat symphonies and carefully placed strings of Forever in favor of tight productions with little more than scarred soul samples and tight, tough beats. The back-to-basics approach works well, not only because it rightly puts the focus back on the best cadre of rappers in the world of hip-hop, but also because RZA's immense trackmaster talents can't help but shine through anyway.
Sea Change	Beck	Rock	2002-09-24 00:00:00	Neumu.net	79.0	Sea Change not only signals a pinnacle in his career but may just be remembered, in an environment fueled by accelerating cycles of disposable culture, as one of this young decade's best records.
Ivory Tower	Chilly Gonzales	Electronic	2010-09-14 00:00:00	PopMatters	68.0	Chilly Gonzales has at least done a fine job shaping its aural side into a stand alone piece. It may be a grab bag, but Ivory Tower's contents are largely satisfying.
Play It As It Lays	Patti Scialfa	Rock	2007-09-04 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	70.0	"On Play It As It Lays, Patti ""Mrs. Bruce Springsteen"" Scialfa sounds like the typical wife of a captain-of-industry type from New Jersey: vaguely bored and unfulfilled."
What About Now	Bon Jovi	Pop/Rock	2013-03-12 00:00:00	The Observer (UK)	50.0	Bon Jovi's 12th studio album finds them on familiar ground, arena-pleasing blue-collar anthems of everyday struggle sitting alongside overblown power ballads.
La Cucaracha	Ween	Indie	2007-10-23 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	73.0	"Next to 2003's comparatively straight-shooting ""Quebec,"" Ween's first studio album in four years is flush with quick right turns."
Higher! [Box Set]	Sly & the Family Stone	R&B;	2013-08-27 00:00:00	Under The Radar	91.0	A high-energy quartet of live tracks from the band's 1970 performance at the Isle of Wright Festival is indispensable, all in all making Higher! the ultimate Sly & The Family Stone document. [Aug-Sep 2013, p.103]
Two Fingers	Two Fingers	Electronic	2009-04-14 00:00:00	Uncut	69.0	Sway, however, doesn't command proceedings quite like Chuck D and the prosaic narratives of tracks like 'That Girl' are no substitute for verbal fireworks. Nearly though. [May 2009, p.101]
Finally Woken	Jem	Electronic	2004-03-23 00:00:00	Urb	70.0	A refreshing batch of summery, carefree downtempo songs. [May 2004, p.85]
This River	JJ Grey	Pop/Rock	2013-04-16 00:00:00	AllMusic	64.0	The songs on This River are tighter and more deftly written than on previous offerings, but the more immediate, in-the-moment-of-creation production and incendiary performances keep things from getting slick.
Steeple	Wolf People	Pop/Rock	2010-10-12 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	77.0	At first listen, Tidings seemed more varied and adventurous than Steeple does. It had moments that hinted at pentatonic scales, exotic tastes of other worlds only compounded by the record's almost utter lack of focus.
Settle	Disclosure	Electronic	2013-06-04 00:00:00	The Fly (UK)	81.0	It’s not perfect--‘Grab Her’ and ‘Stimulation’ both outstay their welcome and the glitchy ‘Second Chance’ feels like it’s from a different album--but it’s a consistently thrilling debut.
She Has No Strings Apollo	Dirty Three	Indie	2003-02-18 00:00:00	E! Online	79.0	A darkly shimmering, intensely brooding and exquisitely melancholy trip.
Another Day On Earth	Brian Eno	Indie	2005-06-14 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	71.0	Another Day On Earth is more blank than frank, a journey through a hollow land, more discreet than it needs to be. Imagine a recording in which every human error has been scrubbed, like coffee grounds off a formica counter.
New Gods	Withered Hand	Pop/Rock	2014-03-25 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	71.0	It is at once assured and endearingly self deprecating. It has an open hearted appeal that just might make Withered Hand a household name.
Luna	The Aliens	Rock	2008-09-29 00:00:00	The Guardian	65.0	'Boats,' which sounds like the sun rising over Laurel Canyon after a heavy night, and the battered, beautiful 'Blue Mantle' make a moving finale to an otherwise frustrating record.
Here We Go Again: Celebrating the Genius of Ray Charles	Willie Nelson	Jazz	2011-03-29 00:00:00	Mojo	63.0	Nelson sounds edgy while Ali Jackson's percussion solo probably looks good on TV but bores aurally. [July 2011, p. 107]
Below the Pink Pony [EP]	The Fauntleroys	Pop/Rock	2014-09-16 00:00:00	Uncut	76.0	This terrific mini-album signals the arrival of an unlikely new set-up. [Dec 2014, p.76]
The Man Upstairs	Robyn Hitchcock	Pop/Rock	2014-08-26 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	70.0	"Not everything clicks, but Hitchcockian takes on songs like Roxy Music's ""To Turn You On,"" the Psychedelic Furs' ""The Ghost in You"" and his own ""Trouble in Your Blood"" are hushed and lovely."
King Animal	Soundgarden	Pop/Rock	2012-11-13 00:00:00	Q Magazine	70.0	"The rest of King Animal struggles to match ""Been Away Too Long"" for musical flair or raw energy. [Dec 2012, p.113]"
Endgame	Rise Against	Pop/Rock	2011-03-15 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	76.0	Endgame, rife with doomsday images, plays to both the band's strengths (shout-from-the-rooftops melodies) and weaknesses (a flair for the melodramatic).
At War With The Mystics	The Flaming Lips	Indie	2006-04-04 00:00:00	AllMusic	76.0	The way that Mystics bounces back and forth between its ethereal and zany moments gives it a disjointed, uneven feel that makes the album a shade less satisfying than either Yoshimi or Soft Bulletin.
OFF!	OFF!	Pop/Rock	2012-05-08 00:00:00	BBC Music	75.0	It's remarkable how purist a reenactment of three-decades-old LA hardcore this record is.
The Hymn of a Broken Man	Times of Grace	Pop/Rock	2011-01-18 00:00:00	Kerrang!	69.0	Your appreciation of the album will depend much on whether you happen to like the way Adam writes: if you do, then this is a belter. If, however, you've grown tired of the same old songs, look elsewhere. [22 Jan 2011, p.50]
Supermodel	Foster the People	Pop/Rock	2014-03-18 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	58.0	While nothing on the album quite reaches those lofty heights [of Pumped Up Kicks], Supermodel far outshines Torches as a whole.
The End of That	Plants and Animals	Pop/Rock	2012-02-28 00:00:00	PopMatters	64.0	The record smartly offers little in the way of answers, instead drawing us into its strange limbo.
Tales Told	Ian Broudie	Indie	2004-10-11 00:00:00	Q Magazine	68.0	The result is somewhere between a Badly Drawn Boy and a strung-out Paul McCartney. [Dec 2004, p.135]
Sleeper	Ty Segall	Pop/Rock	2013-08-20 00:00:00	The Observer (UK)	79.0	It's no straightforward confessional, but a paradigm shift from squalling electricity to intensity of a different sort.

You Were Right	Brendan Benson	Pop/Rock	2013-12-10 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	73.0	You Were Right is never more than solid and, whilst it’s immaculately polished, tired and forgettable lyrics combined with a general sense of 'good enough' about the tunes suggest that Benson is looking forward to The Raconteurs’ return sooner than the rest of us.

Truelove's Gutter	Richard Hawley	Rock	2009-09-22 00:00:00	DavisW.	79.0	Absolutely stunning.
Mug Museum	Cate Le Bon	Pop/Rock	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Boston Globe	77.0	This Welsh singer-songwriter wears her love of the Velvet Underground proudly, particularly on Mug Museum, her third album, which jingles and jangles even when the subject matter turns dark.
Made In The Dark	Hot Chip	Indie	2008-02-05 00:00:00	Under The Radar	78.0	At times, the sheer busyness of the album’s songs prevents the listener from becoming fully immersed. [Winter 2008, p.82]
Wood/Water	The Promise Ring	Indie	2002-04-23 00:00:00	Spin	69.0	Straining to prove something to the haters, the Ring flee from their strengths, trading enthusiastic bash-and-pop for slow songs as soggy as deep cuts from a Train album. [May 2002, p.115]
The Last DJ	Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers	Rock	2002-10-08 00:00:00	PopMatters	61.0	Earnest and straightforward, as rock and roll should be.... The Last DJ is clearly an expression of what Tom Petty feels right now, and his honesty -- coupled with his talent -- is revitalizing.
Feed The Animals	Girl Talk	Rock	2008-09-23 00:00:00	RapReviews.com	76.0	While the tracks never reach and identity outside their own samples Greg does breath fresh new life into them and make things you've probably heard a thousand times, exciting again.
Keel Her	Keel Her	Pop/Rock	2014-02-25 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	64.0	It may not be entirely successful, but it could well be looked back on as the acorn from which a bigger tree grew.
Sweet Sister [EP]	Annuals	Indie	2010-03-30 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	56.0	Here’s hoping Sweet Sister is the sound of a talented group shaking out some superficial songwriting ideas before getting down to it.
Queen of the Wave	Pepe Deluxe	Electronic	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Mojo	70.0	[Their] constant supersize-me approach is a bit exhausting, but few albums this year will strive this hard to entertain. [Feb 2012, p.95]
Heaven Is Whenever	The Hold Steady	Rock	2010-05-04 00:00:00	Mojo	76.0	Established fans will find much to adore, but Finn and company need to be cannier about their long game. [June 2010, p. 98]
Ghosts Of The Great Highway	Sun Kil Moon	Indie	2003-11-04 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	84.0	With a snoozilicious country-rock sound that makes even the Eagles seem crisp by comparison, Kozelek appears to have temporarily mothballed his greater sonic ambitions and opted instead for a niche as a latter-day Mazzy Star for boys.
More Than A Woman	Toni Braxton	Pop	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Dot Music	77.0	Braxton has gotten brave and ratcheted-up both the attitude and tempo.
The Crane Wife	The Decemberists	Indie	2006-10-03 00:00:00	Under The Radar	84.0	The Crane Wife is no sell-out, retaining and even expanding their eccentricities, spinning more of Meloy’s beguiling characters and engrossing stories into their fourth straight, stellar full-length. [#15]
Wincing The Night Away	The Shins	Indie	2007-01-23 00:00:00	The New York Times	79.0	Like the other Shins albums, this one is sneaky; it takes hold slowly but insistently. [22 Jan 2007]
Negative Qualities	Single Mothers	Pop/Rock	2014-10-07 00:00:00	Punknews.org (Staff)	77.0	It's boisterous punk with just enough melodic hardcore embedded to ensure that Single Mothers won't be on any Joyce Manor bills anytime soon.
Lism	Ellen Allien	Electronic	2013-03-19 00:00:00	Q Magazine	63.0	When Allien adds a taste of techno's rhythmic grunt, some focus is briefly achieved, but unfortunately it happens all too briefly. [Apr 2013, p.94]
Hurry Up, We're Dreaming	M83	Electronic	2011-10-18 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	76.0	The end result is an incredibly ambitious and personal effort that shines, sparkles, and thrills.
The Great Destroyer	Low	Indie	2005-01-25 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	82.0	Simply another shimmering LP from a truly original band.
Ready For The Weekend	Calvin Harris	Dance	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Under The Radar	65.0	Ultimately, this is one party you might want to sit out. [Fall 2009, p.74]
Animator	The Luyas	Pop/Rock	2012-10-16 00:00:00	Under The Radar	68.0	The innocent timbre of her voice giving these songs a semblance of hypnotic, warped nursery rhymes. [Oct/Nov 2012, p.123]
NoYork!	Blu	Rap	2013-03-26 00:00:00	RapReviews.com	78.0	York is an interesting and often times bizarre album.
The Grand Theatre, Vol. 1	Old 97's	Country	2010-10-12 00:00:00	PopMatters	74.0	It is wild, slightly unfocused, totally committed, and furiously paced. (Also, it is possibly a bit drunk). But, though this lifts some of the tracks up somewhat, few of them have the depth that one would have wished for.
Big TV	White Lies	Pop/Rock	2013-08-20 00:00:00	PopMatters	64.0	Big TV is a solid album, and it very much retains the White Lies sound. For existing fans it’s worth a listen, and it certainly won’t offend, but it probably won’t convert many new ears.
Wald	Pole	Electronic	2015-09-18 00:00:00	The Quietus	75.0	Wald nods towards electronic Kosmische music of bygone years while simultaneously reflecting and commenting upon Betke's own back catalogue.
Farm	Dinosaur Jr.	Rock	2009-06-23 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	76.0	"So, finally, to Farm, which every bit the equal of ""Beyond;"" maybe even better."
Further Complications	Jarvis Cocker	Indie	2009-05-19 00:00:00	Hot Press	74.0	Brit pop aesthete goes Rawk--sort of.
Happy to You	Miike Snow	Pop/Rock	2012-03-27 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	73.0	Less immediately rewarding than their debut, but worth taking the time to get to know.
We Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves	John Maus	Pop/Rock	2011-06-28 00:00:00	PopMatters	75.0	Unlike Before Today, Maus' third release is less moody, more consistent in its sense of oddness and intrigue. We Must Become... is also consistent in that nearly every track manages to top what came before it.
Mr. Beast	Mogwai	Indie	2006-03-07 00:00:00	The Guardian	74.0	It's all a lesson in taking the rough with the smooth, from the best teachers around.
Watching Dead Empires in Decay	The Stranger	Electronic	2013-10-29 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	77.0	Although Watching Dead Empires In Decay lacks content other than song titles, it evokes spaces that need no explanation.
The Quilt	Gym Class Heroes	Rock	2008-09-09 00:00:00	Pitchfork	69.0	Like their namesake, Quilt's music feels handmade and stitched-together, as though its creators were sifting through a collection of musical hand-me-downs and collating the bits that spoke to them into something new.
Theosophy	Pete Molinari	Folk	2014-06-02 00:00:00	Mojo	75.0	Deftly delivered and heartfelt, a career high. [Jul 2014, p.95]
Wu-Massacre	Meth-Ghost-Rae	Rap	2010-03-30 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	73.0	Ghostface Killah is weirder, Raekwon is gruffer, Method Man is zanier, and here the three kings of Staten Island hip-hop return to their classic-Wu roots like nothing's changed since 1995 but the sports references.
Faking The Books	Lali Puna	Electronic	2004-04-20 00:00:00	Pitchfork	83.0	Faking the Books is a confident stride in the right direction, and proves that, even within the confines of a tired concept, a great hook still goes a long way.
Catastrophe Keeps Us Together	Rainer Maria	Indie	2006-04-04 00:00:00	Under The Radar	74.0	A heartfelt, accessible rock record for emo kids who can't stand eyeliner. [Summer 2006, p.93]
Common Existence	Thursday	Rock	2009-02-17 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	72.0	In places, the album is tremendously affecting, but it's also the first time a Thursday release is not an unambiguous improvement on its predecessor.
In Our Bedroom After The War	Stars	Indie	2007-09-25 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	70.0	In Our Bedroom After The War feels like the conclusion of a journey towards the summit of mount indie pleasance.
MM..Food	MF Doom	Indie	2004-11-16 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	81.0	A collection of culinary-themed tracks... that Doom handles in his surrealistic, unflappable flow. [18 Dec 2004, p.51]

Kasabian	Kasabian	Indie	2005-03-08 00:00:00	E! Online	65.0	If imitation is the biggest form of flattery, everyone involved in the Manchester scene circa 1988 will be smiling ear to ear when they hear Kasabian.
Generation Indigo	Poly Styrene	Pop/Rock	2011-04-26 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	75.0	She left behind this life-force of a new album (recorded before learning she had the disease), full of sharp, buoyant reggae and synth-rock that's true to her personal-is-political vision.
Treats	Sleigh Bells	Indie	2010-06-01 00:00:00	No Ripcord	84.0	Being interesting, unique, fun and damn good is near impossible to pull off. Sleigh Bells has done it on Treats, and goddamn is it good.
This Is Happening	LCD Soundsystem	Indie	2010-05-18 00:00:00	Filter	84.0	Like all good things—especially good byes—it comes to an end. And with that, Mr. Murphy goes out on top.
One Love	David Guetta	Dance	2009-08-25 00:00:00	Observer Music Monthly	66.0	It's the sound of the summer! If summer for you means a fake tan and drinking WKD for a week in the Med with the likes of Kelly Rowland and Will.I.Am popping up as guests with your fave.
Player Piano	Memory Tapes	Electronic	2011-07-05 00:00:00	Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM)	67.0	The songs are so masterfully constructed and the mood throughout so consistent that the key complaint must be that it has to inevitably come to an end; a sure-fire sign that an album is doing something right.
Remember The Night Parties	Oxford Collapse	Indie	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Alternative Press	75.0	One of the brightest and catchy offerings for Sub Pop all year. [Nov 2006, p.188]
Skelethon	Aesop Rock	Rap	2012-07-10 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	79.0	"The chorus sums up why Skelethon sits comfortably with his best albums: ""Take the brain out / Leave the heart in."""
Soulsville	Huey Lewis & the News	Pop/Rock	2010-11-02 00:00:00	AllMusic	57.0	It's an unhurried, affectionate tribute, the News riding grooves that are considerably cleaner than the classic Stax sides they love so much, but they nevertheless wind up with a warm, soulful vibe.
Mazes	Moon Duo	Electronic	2011-03-29 00:00:00	Pitchfork	73.0	Mazes is an exercise in accessibility and concision, using familiar, melodic pop templates to support their drone and krautrock tendencies.
Sounds from Nowheresville	The Ting Tings	Pop/Rock	2012-03-13 00:00:00	The Independent on Sunday (UK)	52.0	This is an album that deserves at least to reacquaint the Ting Tings with the outskirts of Somewheresville.
Live at the Royal Albert Hall	Adele	Pop/Rock	2011-11-29 00:00:00	The Independent (UK)	76.0	Adele's engaging ebullience is powerfully persuasive on this DVD/CD package.
Warpaint	Warpaint	Pop/Rock	2014-01-21 00:00:00	Delusions of Adequacy	74.0	They have indeed created an album that is ultimately rewarding and full of musical promise.
The Hazards Of Love	The Decemberists	Indie	2009-03-24 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	73.0	The band tries out big, fuzzy, folksy blues riffs on tracks like 'The Wanting Comes In Waves/Repaid and The Queen's Rebuke/The Crossing,' but the proggy result is unmemorable and middling.
Chopped and Screwed	Micachu & the Shapes	Pop/Rock	2011-03-08 00:00:00	Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM)	67.0	Chopped & Screwed is an interesting concept that would certainly be fascinating to witness live. However, on record, it does not reach more than a curiosity frequently enough to make it worth many repeat plays.
Feel the Sound	Imperial Teen	Pop/Rock	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM)	71.0	Feel the Sound is not a classic, it's not a masterpiece, and despite its pristine delivery, it's not perfect. But it is an honest and genuine sampling of a band who continues to subvert expectations.
Something To Be	Rob Thomas	Rock	2005-04-19 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	57.0	This is by no means a bad album, but to my ears, it’s worse; it’s mediocre.
Carry on the Grudge	Jamie T	Pop/Rock	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Mojo	81.0	This is a record that rewards digging into Treays' melodic moods and lyrical follies. It is also a staggering collection of exceptional songs. [Oct 2014, p.86]
...Featuring Norah Jones	Norah Jones	Jazz	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Under The Radar	68.0	...Featuring might make a great stocking stuffer for mom, but even she might have trouble swallowing over an hour of Jones; innocuous and predictable soft rock. [Year End 2010, p.77]
The Photo Album	Death Cab for Cutie	Indie	2001-10-09 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	75.0	As intelligent, bittersweet, angular stuff, whether it&#146;s alt.rock, guitar-pop, or even emo is immaterial. Labels be damned - just call it great music.
LCD Soundsystem	LCD Soundsystem	Indie	2005-02-15 00:00:00	Spin	86.0	He's got an excellent ear, a savvy way with hooks, and an untrained voice that knows its limitations. [Mar 2005, p.88]
Pop Negro	El Guincho	Electronic	2010-09-14 00:00:00	AllMusic	74.0	Pop Negro is just as impressive as the debut was. It's just that the indie landscape has shifted so much over that time span that someone blending all sorts of African, Latin, dance, and pop elements and influences into a whirling, glittery disco ball of sound isn't exactly enough to stop the presses.
Admiral Fell Promises	Sun Kil Moon	Pop/Rock	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	77.0	Admiral lacks the strong, emotional storyline of 2008's April and retraces too many of his past musical steps. It's a beautiful, melancholy snapshot of a musician dealing with his past, but he's taken this picture before.
Franz Ferdinand	Franz Ferdinand	Indie	2004-03-09 00:00:00	Urb	87.0	Unlike their inspirations, they've ditched the Marxist polemics in favor of dance-driven ambiguous tales of fumbled romance. [Jun 2004, p.84]
Self Entitled	NOFX	Pop/Rock	2012-09-11 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	68.0	Self/Entitled is a much-welcomed step back in the right direction, offering all the proof long-time fans need that age still hasn't quelled the band's nonconformist, seriocomic ways.
Emika	Emika	Electronic	2011-10-11 00:00:00	AllMusic	78.0	This is a record designed to be listened to in isolation, preferably through a massive pair of high-quality headphones rather than in the mass communal surroundings of a club.
Mirage Rock	Band of Horses	Alternative/Indie Rock	2012-09-18 00:00:00	The Guardian	68.0	Some might miss the old starry-eyed dreamers; other will revel in the focus and determination.
After	Lady Lamb the Beekeeper	Pop/Rock	2015-03-03 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	81.0	While most tracks are easy enough to hum along to, laced with warm banjo and pretty keys, it’s the unexpected explosions of warped guitar solos that make Lady Lamb’s softer moments standout--and the album as a whole succeed.
Here's To Taking It Easy	Phosphorescent	Indie	2010-05-11 00:00:00	Under The Radar	78.0	Houck can finally take it easy with the knowledge that he's made his best record. [Spring 2010, p.65]
The Bright Mississippi	Allen Toussaint	Jazz	2009-04-21 00:00:00	Q Magazine	83.0	He's a terrific piano player, a gift put to exquisite use on this collection of old jazz standards. [Jun 2009, p.132]
Amygdala	DJ Koze	Electronic	2013-04-02 00:00:00	The New York Times	83.0	[A] sleek and immersive new album.
Youth & Young Manhood	Kings of Leon	Rock	2003-08-19 00:00:00	The Guardian	79.0	Using and abusing passionate gospel, country sweetness and filthy guitar licks, the Kings of Leon are the kind of authentic, hairy rebels the Rolling Stones longed to be.
His Hands	Candi Staton	R&B;	2006-04-04 00:00:00	Mojo	79.0	While it's the Oldham-penned title track... which will rightly grab all the headlines, Staton's mastery of more traditional material is no less imposing. [Apr 2006, p.88]
Worlds	Porter Robinson	Electronic	2014-08-12 00:00:00	Uncut	63.0	[Robinson] has certainly indulged his preference here, mixing M83-style synth-pop with Daft Punk/Justice bangers and adding assorted nu-rave and EDM  tropes, to end up with not much to call his own. [Sep 2014, p.76]
Victory For The Comic Muse	The Divine Comedy	Indie	2006-06-19 00:00:00	The Guardian	67.0	[A] triumphant comeback.
Old	Danny Brown	Rap	2013-10-08 00:00:00	The Line of Best Fit	83.0	Old provides expository context and an origin story of sorts for that voice.
Regard The End	Willard Grant Conspiracy	Indie	2004-02-17 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	80.0	Fisher... sings in a deep drawl that splits the difference between Johnny Cash and Nick Cave. [4 Mar 2004, p.66]
True Romance	Charli XCX	Pop	2013-04-16 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	76.0	True Romance is the pop-album equivalent of a wicked Tumblr.
Fingers, Bank Pads and Shoe Prints	RP Boo	Electronic	2015-06-30 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	75.0	It’s a dedicated focus on the materials that compel bodies and minds into motion that make RP Boo a continuously shining light in the ever-growing discourse he helped invent.
Naturally	Men Without Pants	Rock	2008-06-24 00:00:00	Under The Radar	71.0	The resulting album is as expected, but nonetheless interesting, juxtaposition of dirty grooves under a pristine techno framework. [Summer 2008, p.93]
Unreasonable Behavior	Laurent Garnier	Electronic	2000-10-17 00:00:00	Alternative Press	83.0	Though nominally house music, Unreasonable Behavior's tracks expend as much energy on engaging the listener's mind as they do on moving the body. [Dec 2000, p.86]
Director's Cut	Kate Bush	Pop/Rock	2011-05-31 00:00:00	American Songwriter	80.0	None of these cropped and re-imagined takes are drastic enough to add huge insights into Bush's output as they do her finicky outlook on her own work. Work that is, generally, great in any context.
We Were Dead Before The Ship Even Sank	Modest Mouse	Indie	2007-03-20 00:00:00	Lost At Sea	78.0	A disproportionate amount of the album's tracks sound like a commercialized knockoff of previous songs, past highlights revisited after a process of radio ready distillation.
James Farm	James Farm	Jazz	2011-04-26 00:00:00	The Telegraph (UK)	75.0	Even where the musical ideas are strong, they're sapped by the determinedly relaxed ambiance.
Triple F Life: Friends, Fans and Family	Waka Flocka Flame	Rap	2012-06-12 00:00:00	The Source	66.0	What Waka lacks in depth and purpose, he makes up for with conviction. [#253, p.87]
The  Lost Notebooks of Hank Williams	Various Artists	Country	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	79.0	That the album is so wildly uneven perhaps speaks to the underlying quandaries its concept presents.
King Animal	Soundgarden	Pop/Rock	2012-11-13 00:00:00	Rock Sound	70.0	King Animal doesn't hit as hard as their really early material, but it's well-paced.
Threace	Cave	Pop/Rock	2013-10-15 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	77.0	By rising to the high standards of recording and tonal detail set by “kraut” rock pioneers the first time around, and contextualizing the movement’s obsession with repetition within novel structures and rhythms, CAVE’s music sits on a decades-long continuum with the forebears that continue to inspire its members to pick up their instruments and write new music.
Body Language	Kylie Minogue	Dance	2004-02-10 00:00:00	AllMusic	62.0	May well be the best album of her career.
Octahedron	The Mars Volta	Rock	2009-06-23 00:00:00	Boston Globe	66.0	Guitarist Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and singer Cedric Bixler-Zavala are the creative duo driving the band and once again deliver on a standing promise to blow any mind that is willing to stay open.
One Man Revolution	The Nightwatchman	Rock	2007-04-24 00:00:00	Billboard	66.0	Morello shows us that he's a) a facile acoustic guitar player, too, b) a better than serviceable singer and c) an intelligent and passionate social commentator and protest singer. [28 Apr 2007]

Adults can play this album and remember their adolescence with joy and young people can have this as their soundtrack to their ongoing life.

Authentic	LL Cool J	Rap	2013-04-30 00:00:00	AllMusic	46.0	LL sounds rusty and a bit under-rehearsed as he belts out his iffy punch lines and motivational anthems, but he pours his heart into the pop numbers and sounds at home during the nostalgic throwbacks.
Going to Hell	The Pretty Reckless	Pop/Rock	2014-03-18 00:00:00	Kerrang!	58.0	It's a bit rawer, significantly darker and a lot more Momsenier. [15 Mar 2014, p.53]
Shadow of the Sun	Moon Duo	Pop/Rock	2015-03-03 00:00:00	Under The Radar	75.0	"By the time the spacey, seven-minute ""Ice"" rolls around, Moon Duo have molded the album into a frothing, lively psych odyssey."
Perpetuum Mobile	EinstÃ¼rzende Neubauten	Rock	2004-02-10 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	71.0	Perpetuum Mobile is an album of skeletal songs, many of them little more than percussion, bass, and vocals. What's remarkable is the band's ability to create an effective atmosphere with so little -- and much of the credit must go to Bargeld's ever-astonishing voice.
Free Reign	Clinic	Pop/Rock	2012-11-13 00:00:00	The Guardian	72.0	There are lulls elsewhere, but the highlights are a treat.
Sound-Dust	Stereolab	Rock	2001-08-28 00:00:00	Launch.com	71.0	It all sounds nice, but little sticks.
Didn't It Rain	Songs: Ohia	Indie	2002-03-05 00:00:00	Mojo	85.0	The results are mesmeric in their stately extrapolation of gloom. [May 2002, p.102]
The Back Room	Editors	Indie	2006-03-21 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	76.0	The album starts repeating itself and the returns start diminishing.
NYC, Hell 3:00 AM	James Ferraro	Electronic	2013-10-15 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	74.0	Listen to NYC, HELL 3:00 AM close enough and you’ll hear them drumming at the windows of your mind’s storefront.
Amputechture	The Mars Volta	Rock	2006-09-12 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	61.0	All in all, Amputechture can be compared to watching a Hollywood car chase: impressive, but ultimately a heartless experience.
These Are The Good Times People	The Presidents Of The United States Of America	Rock	2008-03-11 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	56.0	These Are The Good Times People is a mere shadow of its ‘90s counterpart that struggles to retain any of the President’s early charm.
King For A Day	Bobby Conn	Indie	2007-02-20 00:00:00	The Guardian	70.0	The artifice of stardom has turned Conn's music anaemic, and the exhausted strings, overexcited guitars and mellow funk grooves end up as disposable as his subjects.
Ceremonials	Florence + the Machine	Pop/Rock	2011-11-01 00:00:00	marktron	75.0	Instead of a nuanced, eclectic collection of songs similar to Lungs, Florence has decided that every second of Ceremonials must sound exactlyInstead of a nuanced, eclectic collection of songs similar to Lungs, Florence has decided that every second of Ceremonials must sound exactly like biggest moments of Dog Days are Over and Cosmic Love. What happens is that all of the songs start to blur together in their big drum, harp, and choir sameness. Highlights include Only If For A Night, Breaking Down and What the Water Gave Me. The rest of the songs are essentially re-writes of those tracks except the failed Adele-esque adult contemporary of Lover To Lover or the embarrassing kid's Halloween movie level of spookiness of Seven Devil's.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;

Varshons	The Lemonheads	Rock	2009-06-23 00:00:00	Boston Globe	67.0	Whether tackling Broadway showtunes or John Prine, or Simon and Garfunkel, the laconic alt-rocker nimbly transforms songs until they sound like they could be his own. That pixie dust extends to Varshons.
Safe Trip Home	Dido	Rock	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	74.0	The emotion in these sad, subtle songs seems inherent enough, though you may still find yourself wishing she'd allowed the slightest hint of it to creep into her voice.

Saint Heron	Various Artists	R&B;	2013-11-11 00:00:00	Pitchfork	75.0	These songs are also song-focused—the artists assembled here may all have deep experimental streaks, but they never ignore pop’s pleasure principle, and there are hooks all over the place on this near-flawlessly sequenced compilation.

It's a cutesy-brutesy masterwork with tons of delightfully catchy riffs and melodies counterpointed by jagged, face-melting rock-outs, often in the same song.  A lot of people can't get over Satomi Matsuzaki's voice and the group's undeniable weirdness, but anyone willing to embrace Deerhoof's eccentricities will find a lot to love here. Few albums can put anyone in a good mood as effortlessly as this glorious, sprawling mess of kitschy ear candy.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Only By The Night	Kings of Leon	Rock	2008-09-23 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	63.0	I have enough faith in this band to presume they’ll eventually see Only By the Night for what it is, as a fourth album hiccup that fails to play to their strengths.
Lease Of Life	Errors	Pop/Rock	2015-03-23 00:00:00	Q Magazine	72.0	If there's an unstable, degraded wobble under their music, it's icily controlled, a deliberate reaction to an uncertain world. [Apr 2015, p.99]

Global	Paul van Dyk	Dance	2003-02-11 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	61.0	Van Dyks's segues are so effortless it's easy to take them for granted, but the precision with which he moves between styles and tempos is a thing of beauty.
When Machines Exceed Human Intelligence	Harmonic 313	Electronic	2009-03-03 00:00:00	PopMatters	75.0	Machines is not just a fantastic album--easily the best work Pritchard has produced since Global Communication--it’s also an early contender for album of the year.
Bardo Pond	Bardo Pond	Pop/Rock	2011-01-11 00:00:00	Rock Sound	71.0	It's hard to fathom how Bardo Pond have made their life-in-a-lava-lamp jams for the best part of 20 years with--we're assuming--their marbles still intact, but here they are, bubbling away with no sign of letting the quality dip.

Dark Comedy	Open Mike Eagle	Rap	2014-06-10 00:00:00	The Independent (UK)	73.0	Set to scratchy, fractured beats and sound-montages, it’s a welcome dose of no-age hip-hop in direct line of descent from De La Soul.

Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action	Franz Ferdinand	Pop/Rock	2013-08-27 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	71.0	By expanding its worldview, Franz Ferdinand has very nicely settled onto a path toward career longevity.
Pacifica	The Presets	Electronic	2012-09-11 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	61.0	From word one to the closing synth note signifying The End, Pacifica is a literary and musical sensation worthy of true scholarly attention.
Blinking Lights And Other Revelations	Eels	Indie	2005-04-26 00:00:00	Playlouder	85.0	Dicing with folly at every stage and coming out victorious, 'Blinking Lights...' is sprawling, galling and downright enthralling.
The High Frontier	Lumerians	Pop/Rock	2013-08-06 00:00:00	The Line of Best Fit	74.0	Despite all of its 33 minutes being recorded in a home built studio that also doubles as a brewery, there’s little to suggest anything particularly wacky rubbed off on the sound.

Natural	Mekons	Rock	2007-08-21 00:00:00	Amazon.com	77.0	It's pretty dour stuff on the whole, but delivered with playfully melodic wit and a certain poetic resignation usually found only in the hearts of forgotten souls and madmen (and maybe Tom Waits).
Crazy Clown Time	David Lynch	Pop/Rock	2011-11-08 00:00:00	Spin	62.0	Lynch handles most everything else here--vocals, guitar, writing, production--creating soundscapes that are dark, unsettling, and often confusing.
Below The Branches	Kelley Stoltz	Indie	2006-02-07 00:00:00	Lost At Sea	79.0	A wonderful pop record.
Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz	Miley Cyrus	Pop/Rock	2015-08-30 00:00:00	Billboard.com	60.0	There’s a semblance of a flow to the record’s sprawling track list, but too many songs sound hastily written, and too often Cyrus acts as if her drug trip is more poignant than the average freakout.
The Visiter	The Dodos	Indie	2008-03-18 00:00:00	AllMusic	83.0	Visiter's experimental pop is so joyous and liberated-sounding that it's difficult not to get swept along in its wake.
Further Complications	Jarvis Cocker	Indie	2009-05-19 00:00:00	The Boston Phoenix	74.0	The meta quality of the immoral, libidinous singer refracted through unblinking irony feels too transparent for a songwriter of Cocker's depth.
Fly Or Die	N.E.R.D. [The Neptunes]	Rock	2004-03-23 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	68.0	They sound like they sincerely believe the greatest thing that ever happened to rock & roll is Sammy Hagar's solo career.
Black Market Music	Placebo	Rock	2001-05-08 00:00:00	HOB.com	65.0	Placebo's indie-glam rock fusion still sounds on CD like a good idea, and little more.
Reality	David Bowie	Rock	2003-09-16 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	74.0	Neither a calculated trip to Bowie's past nor a wagon-hitching ride to current pop trends, the album has an energy all its own.
Great Big Flamingo Burning Moon	The Wave Pictures	Pop/Rock	2015-02-16 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	74.0	It’s a messy record, in the best possible way: organic and live sounding, with few overdubs and little complication, tipping its hat constantly to its retro inspirationg.
Scratch My Back	Peter Gabriel	Rock	2010-03-02 00:00:00	Billboard.com	67.0	It may take listeners a while to wrap their heads (and ears) around Scratch My Back, but it will undoubtedly polarize an audience that has long awaited something new from Gabriel.
Fatherfucker	Peaches	Indie	2003-09-23 00:00:00	PopMatters	70.0	Quite a few tracks simultaneously lack subtlety and boldness, reverting to the kind of scatological shock bag you might expect from a third-rate performance artist.

Perch Patchwork	Maps & Atlases	Pop/Rock	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Q Magazine	70.0	Solid ground is simply beautiful, David Davison's reedy warble offset by a ghostly mellotron, while campfire strum-along Was and power-pop gem Israeli Caves are proof that their melodic detour was well worth the effort. [Nov 2010, p.111]
The Craft	Blackalicious	Rap	2005-09-27 00:00:00	AllMusic	80.0	"While the first half of the album may sound like a watered-down Blazing Arrow, everything picks up when the duo unveil two of the grooviest message tracks since Stevie Wonder's ""Livin' for the City"" in ""The Fall and Rise of Elliot Brown"" and ""Black Diamonds and Pearls."""
Pleasure	Pure X	Pop/Rock	2011-07-05 00:00:00	The Guardian	70.0	Pleasure drifts in and out of focus--some of the 10 tracks aren't even complete songs, just a hook that fades in and fades out again, having stumbled along pleasantly for a couple of minutes, with Nate Grace's guitar cutting through the amniotic fug.
Fire from the Sky	Shadows Fall	Pop/Rock	2012-05-15 00:00:00	Kerrang!	81.0	It's a lean, mean metallic assault from a band who only seem to get better with age. [11 Aug 2012, p.53]

In Love	Peace	Pop/Rock	2013-03-25 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	72.0	As Britain suffers from youth unemployment and economic crisis, our greatest currency is the chime of a golden tune. Peace have delivered 10 of them.
Another Eternity	Purity Ring	Electronic	2015-03-03 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	70.0	Another Eternity seems more focused on entertaining large masses of people than creating meaningful art. That’s all fine and good, but that sort of cash and popularity grab might prove that all that past skepticism was well-placed.
Doctor's Advocate	The Game	Rap	2006-11-14 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	73.0	Doctor's Advocate isn't the classic that message boards are calling it, but it is a middling yet pleasurable record.
Shine On	Jet	Rock	2006-10-03 00:00:00	AllMusic	62.0	Shine On is a good album that avoids the sophomore slump, but has enough moments of rote rocking to make the next record a worrisome prospect.
The  King Is Dead	The Decemberists	Pop/Rock	2011-01-18 00:00:00	Rock Sound	77.0	The way they put together their country-rock is rarely less than tasteful with some nice moments, like the sinuous guitar riff of 'Calamity Song'. Only on 'January Hymn', though, where they capture the stillness and melancholy of winter beautifully, do you forget to check the joinery.
Ego Death	The Internet	R&B;	2015-06-29 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	81.0	In addition to their more fully formed sound, one of the more exciting things about The Internet is the music’s point of view.
Kick	White Rose Movement	Indie	2006-04-17 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	67.0	Even The Bravery, easily the most similar band in approach to White Rose Movement and rightly derided for their style over substance rehashes of the past, at least had a couple of memorably fine songs. The White Rose Movement, on the other hand, have the style, but little substance to back it up.
Nobody's Daughter	Hole	Rock	2010-04-27 00:00:00	Chicago Tribune	57.0	Songwriters Linda Perry and Billy Corgan (moonlighting from the Smashing Pumpkins), producer Michael Beinhorn--sand down her rough edges and turn Nobody's Daughter into a dreary piece of middle-of-the-road product.
I Never Learn	Lykke Li	Pop/Rock	2014-05-06 00:00:00	The New York Times	77.0	This is harsh, unyielding stuff, and most of this jolting album contains more the same. On her two previous albums, Lykke Li has been something of a floating presence, but everything about this album is intensely grounded.

IDM was andAfter Skinny Puppy released Last Rights back in 1992, there has been very little that is actually ""new"" going on in pop music. IDM was and continues to be cool but very little of it feels organic, emotional or dynamic (Autechre conintues to try though). There have been plenty of great bands since then but they have all been tied in one way or another to other older bands. That is the one great risk none of them seem to want to take which is fine as long as they make good music. But here is Xiu Xiu, wow! Noise, and good noise at that, mixed with snippets of melody and hooks. I can&#039;t believe a band is making the type of pop music I actually want to hear. If you think this is too pretentious or noisy then there are plenty of less dynamic bands for you to roll with and they will tap any nostalgic bone you have for $18.00. However if you feel like something is desperately missing from pop music, like how you expected your kids music in the future to be louder and noisy than your music and not this pussy ass crap kids listen to these days, then Xiu Xiu is there for you.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"
Love Songs for Robots	Patrick Watson	Pop/Rock	2015-05-12 00:00:00	AllMusic	76.0	In the end, Love Songs for Robots is well represented by its title: weird, heartfelt, haunting, stimulating, and unexpectedly sultry; it holds much for humans to appreciate, too.
Sorry	White Lung	Pop/Rock	2012-05-29 00:00:00	Pitchfork	76.0	Way's most compelling moments on Sorry are those in which she's particularly hellish, strong, and lyrically bold.
Between My Head and the Sky	Yoko Ono Plastic Ono Band	Rock	2009-09-22 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	83.0	With this revised version of the band, that role has evolved. There are more reflective pieces characterized by subdued piano accompaniment, and occasional touches that make the rock music distinctive.
G-Sides	Gorillaz	Rock	2002-02-26 00:00:00	CDNow	65.0	Most of these re-workings preserve the essential nature of the songs; the producers know enough to stay out of the way.
Infra	Max Richter	Electronic	2010-07-20 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	77.0	What Infra is, is perfectly pretty, atmospheric, rainy day music.
Snakeoil	Tim Berne	Jazz	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	80.0	The alto saxophonist's reptilian coils of brass all but sprout wings on Snakeoil's six songs in 68 minutes, and the piano, drums, and clarinet/bass clarinet team with a Darwinian tension.
Spiderwebbed	Stumbleine	Pop/Rock	2012-10-30 00:00:00	Clash Music	80.0	It may be a tried and tested formula but inspiration as beautifully realised as this is hard to ignore.
Where the Messengers Meet	Mt. St. Helens Vietnam Band	Pop/Rock	2010-08-03 00:00:00	PopMatters	64.0	It's got a lot of good musical ideas, but very few of those ideas seem to come to fruition.
Feel That Fire	Dierks Bentley	Country	2009-02-03 00:00:00	AllMusic	62.0	It would be nice if some of the titular burn could be felt on Dierks Bentley's fourth studio album, but Feel That Fire is an atypically cautious, calculated affair from one of Nashville's best singer/songwriters of the 2000s.
Everything Goes Wrong	Vivian Girls	Indie	2009-09-08 00:00:00	Los Angeles Times	66.0	Cassie Ramone sounds like a more confident guitarist, stretching out her leads, while the bass lines of Kickball Katy bubble out front to carry the melodies. And once again those melancholy harmonies are to die for, as Ramone chips off pieces of her heart in lamenting the boy who got away.
The Beautiful Old Turn-Of-The-Century Songs	Various Artists	Pop/Rock	2013-06-11 00:00:00	The Independent on Sunday (UK)	86.0	A fascinating collection of songs from the 19th and early 20th centuries.
Reality Killed The Video Star	Robbie Williams	Rock	2009-11-17 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	64.0	The more you delve into it the less you find, because it’s all affectation.
Our Love To Admire	Interpol	Indie	2007-07-10 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	70.0	Interpol's third LP sounds more or less like the last two, and that's its biggest problem.
Start Something	Lostprophets	Rock	2004-02-03 00:00:00	Logo	70.0	This is a perplexing album: two excellent singles, a few stellar moments of vicious riffage, but little to assuage that lingering sense of emptiness.
Power In Numbers	Jurassic 5	Rap	2002-10-08 00:00:00	Splendid	76.0	As spiritual as Talib Kweli, as musically complex as Mos Def, as joyfully syncopated as the Roots, Power in Numbers sets the standard for intelligent hip hop.
The Virgins	The Virgins	Rock	2008-06-03 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	67.0	The Virgins is punchy and slinky and over before you know it, but good, dirty fun while it lasts.

Sainthood	Tegan and Sara	Rock	2009-10-27 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	78.0	The arrangements are consistently dynamic and clear, but Tegan & Sara’s wordy vocals steal the show.

The Fame	Lady Gaga	Rock	2008-10-28 00:00:00	Dot Music	71.0	The Fame is a very unusual beast: a sparkling pop album crammed with infectious melodies that you somehow never, ever want to hear again.
Runddans	Todd Rundgren	Electronic	2015-05-04 00:00:00	The Guardian	63.0	The vibe is more often trippy and transcendental than indulgent, whereas even the most far-out moments fail to disguise Rundgren’s pop nous, most evident in the synth rushes of Put Your Arms Around Me and the electrifying soloing that follows it.
Below the Pink Pony [EP]	The Fauntleroys	Pop/Rock	2014-09-16 00:00:00	PopMatters	76.0	All raw nerve, frenetic energy, and inspiration, it’s the sound of a group confident in its playing, trusting in their surroundings, and eager to let loose.
Me First	The Elected	Indie	2004-02-03 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	80.0	"Peppered with dissatisfying, mommy-daddy emotastic lyrics, Jeff Tweedy impressions, and Four Tet-inspired, stop-on-a-dime, into-something-totally-unrelated segues that don't really belong on a country-twinged ""let's hang out, drink, and make a record, dudes"" kind of affair."

Beaus$eros	Busdriver	Rap	2012-02-21 00:00:00	No Ripcord	62.0	More quickly than you'd expect, Busdriver's quirks become endearing; his cartoonish vocal stretches to reach those high notes become normalised and you begin to appreciate how much heart he puts into his singing.
Drums Between the Bells	Brian Eno	Electronic	2011-07-05 00:00:00	The Quietus	68.0	The combination of Eno's obsession with stasis and his attachment to novelty for its own sake does the album in.
New Alhambra	Elvis Depressedly	Pop/Rock	2015-05-12 00:00:00	Pitchfork	75.0	For New Alhambra, his seventh and latest release as Elvis Depressedly, he's crafted a utopian sort of indie-pop, an ecstatic evocation of the second coming, professional wrestling, and radical positivity.
The Camel's Back	Psapp	Rock	2009-02-17 00:00:00	PopMatters	72.0	The Camel’s Back is so perfectly judged and crafted, so busy and disparate and yet so harmonious and consistent that it marks a definitely improvement in the duo’s work.

Leaders Of The Free World	Elbow	Indie	2006-02-21 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	78.0	Leaders Of The Free World would seem by-the-book Brit rock, if it weren't for Guy Garvey. Gruff but generous, with a voice like Peter Gabriel minus the ego, Garvey masters the role of sensitive frontman by staying grounded. [Feb/Mar 2006, p.104]
Walk the Moon	Walk the Moon	Pop/Rock	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	67.0	Walk the Moon [is] a lukewarm, uninspiring collection of generic pop songs.
Invicta	Hit the Lights	Pop/Rock	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Rock Sound	63.0	There are enough early anthems included to warrant picking this up, if only as a gateway to their back catalogue.

Pink City	Jennifer Castle	Pop/Rock	2014-09-02 00:00:00	Pitchfork	85.0	Even as she treads upon dead earth, Castle’s connection to nature is potent as ever: with Pink City, she reminds us of how good it feels to be alive, even when life gets in the way.
VYP: Voice of the Young People	Lil' Mama	Rap	2008-04-29 00:00:00	Blender	71.0	Though there’s slick, occasionally dynamite production from the likes of the Runners and Scott Storch, the lyrics rarely rise above defensive boasting (“One Hit Wonder”), frigid sex raps (“What It Is [Strike a Pose]”) and rote autobiography (“College”).
American Gong	Quasi	Indie	2010-02-23 00:00:00	AllMusic	71.0	The result is a frustrating listening experience that makes you wish that the change in their sound didn't prove to be so fleeting. That being said, if you've stood beside the band for this long, there's nothing here to make you sorry that you did.
Staind	Staind	Pop/Rock	2011-09-13 00:00:00	Revolver	55.0	A welcome surprise.
Blood	Lianne La Havas	Pop/Rock	2015-07-31 00:00:00	The Observer (UK)	72.0	The feather-light touch of La Havas’s voice can be deceptive; for all her apparent ease, there are sufficient quirks and depths to her writing, not least the scientific analogies on Wonderful (electricity) and Unstoppable (astrophysics).
Shootenanny!	Eels	Rock	2003-06-03 00:00:00	Launch.com	73.0	It's better than Souljacker, though not quite as good as Electro-Shock Blues and Daisies Of The Galaxy.
Twins	Ty Segall	Pop/Rock	2012-10-09 00:00:00	Boston Globe	80.0	In exciting displays of versatility throughout the album, Segall grimes it up then unplugs, freaks out then holds back, wails then moans--all in utter confidence.

Hymn To The Immortal Wind	Mono	Rock	2009-03-24 00:00:00	PopMatters	75.0	Those listeners in the middle may find that without anything making it stand out from the bulk of what we’re calling post-rock, Hymns to the Immortal Wind registers as another solid entry in a genre so consistent that merely solid entries aren’t enough to gain your love as well as your respect.
Blue Record	Baroness	Rock	2009-10-13 00:00:00	MikeC	87.0	Poor song-writing damages what could have a been a fine album.

English Oceans	Drive-By Truckers	Pop/Rock	2014-03-04 00:00:00	Uncut	78.0	While English Oceans carries its quota of Truckers staples, there's also much that sets this fantastic 10th studio album apart from its predecessors. [Apr 2014, p.82]
Glazin'	Jacuzzi Boys	Pop/Rock	2011-08-29 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	69.0	Glazin' draws from the swagger of glam, the hooky middle-ground of '70s punk and '60s rock 'n' roll, but also demonstrates a clear understanding of the way those sounds have already been appropriated by millennial garage pranksters (like, most notably, the Black Lips).
Overcome	All That Remains	Rock	2008-09-16 00:00:00	TheQuietGamer	66.0	"The band's follow up to ""The Fall of Ideals"" is not what many were expecting. Yet even when it strays away from metal it stays a fantasticThe band's follow up to ""The Fall of Ideals"" is not what many were expecting. Yet even when it strays away from metal it stays a fantastic hard-rock album. Things never get too soft.Most of the songs still feature the heavy, aggressive vocals the group is known for. Same goes for the instrumentals. The difference here is that there are a few songs with a more melodic quality. Clean vocals are used in songs more frequently in the choruses.However a few songs like ""Two Weeks"" are almost completely comprised of clean vocals. Something that may turn off those looking for straight up heavy, loud, and aggressive metal. I personally feel that there's a nice balance.Luckily though this album shouldn't be too big of a turn off for longtime fans, as it keeps the majority of it metal even if it's not as strong as the previous albums. Regardless the band still shows massive talent here and made an all around excellent metal album. One that I really have trouble finding any fault with.My total score for All That Remain's album ""Overcome"" is a 9.9/10.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"
Manifesto	Inspectah Deck	Rap	2010-03-23 00:00:00	Pitchfork	62.0	As Manifesto runs through its forbidding 20-track playlist, it unsurprisingly falters when it chases Hot 97 spins that are laughably out of reach.
45:33	LCD Soundsystem	Electronic	2007-11-13 00:00:00	Pitchfork	86.0	I can attest that the music really does move forward similarly to my own metabolism, gradually building, holding a modest climax in the middle, and ending on a long, fluffy comedown. [Review of UK release]
Covering Ground	Chuck Ragan	Pop/Rock	2011-09-13 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	78.0	Covering Ground is an accessible, listenable peek into Ragan's vision of acoustic music, and it will appeal to the punks and the folkies alike.
To Pimp A Butterfly	Kendrick Lamar	Rap	2015-03-16 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	96.0	An album that, lacking the neatly redemptive arc of 'good kid, mAAd city', is also grand and slightly unwieldy.
College Dropout	Kanye West	Rap	2004-02-10 00:00:00	Spin	87.0	Most producers who approach the mic do so at their peril, but on Dropout, West turns out to be a full-service hip-hop artiste.
#willpower	will.i.am	Pop	2013-04-23 00:00:00	The Guardian	49.0	The songs featuring him alone may be full of undeniably funny arrogance, but they're also laden with recycled beats and Auto-Tune.
In The Clear	Ivy	Indie	2005-03-01 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	73.0	Once you get past the initial, pleasing familiarity, though, In the Clear becomes a decidedly middling listening experience.
Somewhere Gone	Exene Cervenka	Rock	2009-10-06 00:00:00	AllMusic	72.0	Somewhere Gone is a different animal from Cervenka's acoustic music of the late '80s and early '90s, at once simpler, riskier, and more confident, and it captures one of the great wild talents of her generation in strong and impressive form, still unafraid to take her talent in new directions after more than a quarter-century of blazing trails.

Ghost Culture	Ghost Culture	Electronic	2015-01-20 00:00:00	Clash Music	81.0	From the flicks of tousled hair and being pale and away with the fairies, the end product sounds more masterful and comfortingly in control than other fashion zeitgeists and angular pouters with every listen.
22 Dreams	Paul Weller	Rock	2008-07-22 00:00:00	AllMusic	77.0	Although it shares superficial sonic similarities with his other records, 22 Dreams is really unlike any of Weller's other albums, as it's rich in sound and feeling, possessing a shimmering dreamy quality. It's an album to get lost in.
Madvillainy	Madvillain	Indie	2004-03-23 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	93.0	While every Ivy League dog kennel worker with a paycheck from Blender or Revolver may write dissertations about how Outkast re-invented pop music (and if we follow that logic) then Madvillain simply destroys the boundaries.
Boo! Human	Joan of Arc	Indie	2008-05-20 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	71.0	Boo! Human is a tough listen that just gets tougher. But the window Kinsella opens into his bruised soul almost reads like a mea culpa, some twisted kind of penitence for two decades of cryptic, evasive lyrics.
Between the Stars	Flyleaf	Pop/Rock	2014-09-16 00:00:00	Revolver	76.0	Between the Stars is tight and melodic and unrelentingly hook-driven, poppy enough in places to recall Paramore or even (on the great new single “Set Me on Fire”) a more ferocious No Doub
Starry Mind	P.G. Six	Pop/Rock	2011-08-23 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	79.0	Starry Mind is both an effortless listen and a taxing one, blending easily into one's surroundings while also rewarding intense examination.
DJ-Kicks	Brandt Brauer Frick	Electronic	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Mixmag	69.0	Opener ‘Miami Theme’ sets the tone, Erika Janunger’s voice floating over brooding piano chords, like a Lynchian club scene.
Milk Money	Dosh	Rap	2013-10-22 00:00:00	Blurt Magazine	73.0	The experimental sonic world Dosh creates is beautiful and he has created an eerily enchanting one with Milk Money.
Native Speaker	The Braids	Pop/Rock	2011-01-18 00:00:00	AllMusic	76.0	Standell-Preston's vocals can border on grating, and sometimes the band's approach feels formless instead of abstract. Nevertheless, Braids' uniquely feminine experimental pop is largely a success.
We Love Life	Pulp	Rock	2002-08-20 00:00:00	Spin	84.0	Preposterous and sensational, We Love Life grapples with nothing less than how best to prove you're alive. [Oct 2002, p.116]
The Scene Between	The Go! Team	Pop/Rock	2015-03-24 00:00:00	DIY Magazine	75.0	It’s got moments of music that sound like life. And when the songwriting is interesting and the melodies evocative, what you need is something to keep up what they’ve built.

New Roman Times	Camper Van Beethoven	Indie	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Q Magazine	68.0	There's too much instrumental cleverness to get to grips with the theme. [Nov 2004, p.118]
Let's Be Still	The Head and the Heart	Pop/Rock	2013-10-15 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	72.0	On Let’s Be Still, the warm vocal tandem of Josiah Johnson and Jonathan Russell is pared down to its core vibrancy, as two soul-sapped, lovelorn bellowers more casually croon their wishes and woes.
Where Shall You Take Me	Damien Jurado	Indie	2003-03-18 00:00:00	The Wire	88.0	Jurado's spare, edgy songs are miniature masterpieces of mood and character. [#229, p.68]
American Gangster	Jay-Z	Rap	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	83.0	Patchy, perhaps, but there's plenty over the course of American Gangster to suggest that, even if sullied by a lack of prolificacy, at least the Brooklyn beatnik is keeping the right company again.

Several Shades of Why	J Mascis	Pop/Rock	2011-03-15 00:00:00	American Songwriter	78.0	Even without his electric axe (and accompanying pedal board and crater of Marshall stacks) Mascis is still a virtuso.

SBTRKT	SBTRKT	Electronic	2011-06-28 00:00:00	The Guardian	76.0	His debut LP marks his most coherent effort yet, moving from glitchy opener Heatwave into downbeat garage on Hold On and choppy synths on the euphoric Sanctuary.
Now You Know	Doug Martsch	Indie	2002-09-17 00:00:00	Billboard	74.0	"The aptly titled ""Now You Know"" shouldn't be perceived as the end of Martsch's indie rock affiliation, but the sound of an artist delving deeper, and in doing so, hitting his stride."
The Process Of Belief	Bad Religion	Rock	2002-01-22 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	74.0	Plunges right back into oppressively rigid formula.

Trilogy	The Weeknd	R&B;	2012-11-13 00:00:00	PopMatters	79.0	The Weeknd's emotional range starts at regret and ends at lament, and the new tracks on Trilogy don't do much to change that. Indeed, they sequence so seamlessly into the larger body of his work that they complete it and close it off.
This Is the Computers	The Computers	Pop/Rock	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Kerrang!	70.0	While the Exeter band stick with the same formula throughout, they do successfully shackle the principle of less is more--if you're tiring of tone of the songs, another will come charging in to replace it before you can hit skip.

This Harness Can't Ride Anything	Chin Up Chin Up	Indie	2006-10-10 00:00:00	Alternative Press	74.0	It's nothing short of their highest point to date. [Nov 2006, p.188]
Skull Worship	The Warlocks	Pop/Rock	2013-11-26 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	68.0	In between, it’s a wade through thick sonic sludge, but the oncoming doom of ‘Endless Drops’ is bleakly tuneful and ‘He Looks Good In Space’ is soothing.
Live In New York City	Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band	Rock	2001-04-03 00:00:00	Wall of Sound	75.0	Unlike the then-career-spanning three-CD set Live 1975-1985, which was notorious for its sanitizing overdubs, Live in New York City for the most part captures the feel of a live Springsteen show.
Quicksand / Cradlesnakes	Califone	Indie	2003-03-18 00:00:00	AllMusic	86.0	Is less a bold statement of principle as it is a blossoming into maturity.

Built From Scratch	The X-Ecutioners	Rap	2002-01-29 00:00:00	AllMusic	62.0	Built From Scratch is a sharp ode to old school hip-hop that focuses on the roll of the turntable rather than the vocals of an MC.
The Menace	Elastica	Rock	2000-08-22 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	69.0	It's hard to imagine Elastica's fans being patient or loyal enough to care much either way about The Menace, though it's artistically solid enough to warrant consideration.
Shangri-la	Mark Knopfler	Rock	2004-09-28 00:00:00	Blender	65.0	Like [J.J.] Cale, Knopfler prefers murmuring to emoting while threading fancy little guitar figures through songs that can't decide whether to shuffle into the haze or nod off. [Nov 2004, p.136]

12 Desperate Straight Lines	Telekinesis	Pop/Rock	2011-02-15 00:00:00	Under The Radar	69.0	No one would fault this solid sequel if it wanted to add some of its own exclamation points to its title.
Comfort Eagle	Cake	Rock	2001-07-24 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	70.0	The sweetest moments come when frontman John McCrea breaks from the formula and extends his baritone beyond a single note, as on the harmony fueled ''Pretty Pink Ribbon'' and the yearning ''World of Two.''
For The Lions	Hatebreed	Rock	2009-05-05 00:00:00	No Ripcord	66.0	Overstuffed and a little undercooked, Lions suffers from the fact that Hatebreed’s influences aren’t terribly diverse, and many of the short, hard, and fast numbers tend to blend together in a way that won’t appeal to anyone without a working knowledge of the American hardcore canon.
Old Ramon	Red House Painters	Indie	2001-04-10 00:00:00	PopMatters	84.0	Taken as a whole, Old Ramon is a brilliant mopey stroll through San Francisco's slate gray streets.
Traveling Alone	Tift Merritt	Country	2012-10-02 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	79.0	Tift Merritt strips things down on her raw fifth album, letting her aching vocals and bewitching twang do all the convincing. [5 Oct 2012, p.77]
Beauty And The Beat	Edan	Rap	2005-03-29 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	85.0	It's sucker punch after sucker punch of syllable-swapping fun.
Trespassing	Adam Lambert	Pop/Rock	2012-05-15 00:00:00	The Observer (UK)	66.0	Trespassing isn't a totally cogent statement. Lambert suffers from a lack of restraint, while the second half of the album lags. But you have to admire Lambert's ability to go over the top and then ratchet higher still.
Eat Pray Thug	Heems	Rap	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Pitchfork	76.0	Eat Pray Thug isn’t lacking in ideas, just focus, and there are long stretches where it’s much harder to connect to Heems’ persona.
Safe Trip Home	Dido	Rock	2008-11-18 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	74.0	The album reveals nuances and feels richer with repeated plays, even though there's no single track that demands repeat listens. For songs that are just fine, they're great.
Angel	Pure X	Pop/Rock	2014-04-01 00:00:00	Pretty Much Amazing	73.0	It’s a heartfelt, narcotic odyssey through the seductive pleasures of lava lamps and black light posters, a kind of escapism that comes in the same strange, silk-screened colors as the novelty lighters and t-shirts one might find at a backwoods southwestern gas station.
I Love You	Jason Urick	Electronic	2012-01-24 00:00:00	Under The Radar	78.0	Sure, it's all dulcet ambience, but it's easy to appreciate the personality. [#39, p.74]
Kala	M.I.A.	Rap	2007-08-21 00:00:00	Lost At Sea	87.0	Kala is only received as a political record if you listen up properly. The music itself no longer asserts itself like a militia; it's too calm and more scattered.

Antiphon	Midlake	Pop/Rock	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Classic Rock Magazine	74.0	Here they're more rock than folk--or, to be exact, more prog than folk, extending the jams and minimising the survivalist backwoodsman imagery for more obtuse bong-flavoured lyrics. [Dec 2013, p.103]
Be As You Are (Songs From An Old Blue Chair)	Kenny Chesney	Country	2005-01-25 00:00:00	Los Angeles Times	63.0	Not surprisingly, the music is heavy on acoustic guitars and steel drums, light on powerhouse percussion, making for a musical tour as relaxing as a ride in a hammock strung between two palm trees. And about as uneventful. [23 Jan 2005]
Liz Phair	Liz Phair	Pop	2003-06-24 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	40.0	Worst of all, the album closes with three decent songs, reminders of Phair's talent that are muted by what's come before.

Sound Of Silver	LCD Soundsystem	Indie	2007-03-20 00:00:00	Spin	86.0	Over and over, these songs reveal how a wisecracking record geek can still achieve rapture. [Mar 2007, p.98]
Songs In A Minor	Alicia Keys	R&B;	2001-06-05 00:00:00	Launch.com	78.0	"The mournful, blues-and-gospel-based ""Fallin'""--a great song that was certainly no obvious choice as the first single--is the most notable declaration of independence, but Songs In A Minor is full of them."
Hyacinths and Thistles	The 6ths	Indie	2000-09-05 00:00:00	TimT.	68.0	Hard to fault the songs--the finest, most-sustained collection of Merritt&#039;s work. The only shortcoming I can see is the writing styleHard to fault the songs--the finest, most-sustained collection of Merritt&#039;s work. The only shortcoming I can see is the writing style forces the singer to adopt Merritt&#039;s own vocal delivery.

Have You Fed the Fish?	Badly Drawn Boy	Rock	2002-11-05 00:00:00	Dot Music	77.0	Where once the bark was of Beck, we have - and this hurts - Wings.
TOY	TOY	Pop/Rock	2012-09-25 00:00:00	No Ripcord	77.0	They're much fuzzier than Deerhunter, more jam-inclined than The Horrors, far lighter than Slowdive – and if it's true that they're introducing the kids to krautrock and psychedelia I'm all for it. Perhaps more of an homage than an invention, then, but still, an absorbing debut.
Discovery of a World Inside the Moone	The Apples In Stereo	Indie	2000-04-18 00:00:00	Village Voice (Consumer Guide)	82.0	Lyrics swirl around sensibly and the formidable tunesmithing never goes down the drain.
Folie A Deux	Fall Out Boy	Rock	2008-12-16 00:00:00	PopMatters	73.0	Though Folie a Deux is still riddled with problems (ending the disc with the Survivor-esque closer 'West Coast Smoker' makes for a somewhat hurried conclusion), it’s still a musical leap in the right direction for the band, as it adds just enough new elements to keep things interesting while not straying too far from the sound that made them big in the first place.
Reflektor	Arcade Fire	Pop/Rock	2013-10-29 00:00:00	Pitchfork	80.0	They've given us something in the present tense that, these days, feels depressingly unfashionable: An Event--an album that dares to be great, and remarkably succeeds.
Aabenbaringen Over Aaskammen	Casiokids	Pop/Rock	2011-10-11 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	72.0	With much of the album sounding like the rest of their catalog, there isn't enough innovation within the entire affair.
Our Earthly Pleasures	Maxïmo Park	Indie	2007-05-08 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	67.0	Doesn't quite have the same impact as their debut.
The Midnight Organ Fight	Frightened Rabbit	Indie	2008-04-29 00:00:00	Magnet	80.0	The Midnight Organ Fight's bloodied-but-unbowed lyrics stand up to repeated listening even on the fastest cutes. [Summer 2008, p.106]
Warnings/Promises	Idlewild	Rock	2005-08-16 00:00:00	The Guardian	66.0	A slightly awkward composite of the band's old strengths and a flurry of new ideas.
The Way Of The World	Mose Allison	Jazz	2010-03-23 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	78.0	The Way of the World is just one more Mose Allison album: exceptional in it’s own right but entirely expected.
We'll Live and Die in These Towns	The Enemy	Indie	2007-07-09 00:00:00	Under The Radar	61.0	These three Coventry lads crank out a predictable rock album with no real direction at all. [Fall 2008, p.86]

Leave This Town	Daughtry	Rock	2009-07-14 00:00:00	Los Angeles Times	59.0	This is by-the-numbers arena rock, played with muscular competence by a relatively young band showing off its chops by executing successful formulas.
Conor Oberst	Conor Oberst	Rock	2008-08-05 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	76.0	From admittedly unsympathetic ears, it’s a fruitless mess caked with vanity and smothered by its own insular delusions of prosperity.
Let It Come Down	Spiritualized	Rock	2001-09-25 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	74.0	Pierce shows neither the vocal presence nor the songwriting chops to justify Let It Come Down's bloated orchestral excess.

Modern Rituals	Chief	Pop/Rock	2010-08-17 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	56.0	Zig-zagging cross-country has afforded the band a subtle grasp: while West Coast sunshine glows from their every chord, they are not bound to Pacific pop principles, and their dexterous handling renders Modern Rituals a beguiling proposition and Chief a band to keep a very close eye on.
The Grotto	Kristin Hersh	Indie	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Delusions of Adequacy	75.0	Possibly the best Kristin Hersh solo album since 1994's classic Hips & Makers.
No Love Deep Web	Death Grips	Rap	2013-11-19 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	76.0	Nihilism doesn't even begin to describe the mood created by the skittering electronic drums, uneasy atmospheric noises and MC Ride's manic scream-rapping.
Migrant	The Dear Hunter	Pop/Rock	2013-04-02 00:00:00	justcharlton	78.0	Migrant is a beautiful album that ebbs and flows with orchestral rhythm and tongue lashing lyrics. This was the first album I found of TheMigrant is a beautiful album that ebbs and flows with orchestral rhythm and tongue lashing lyrics. This was the first album I found of The Dear Hunter and I must say its the type of album that makes you want more instantly. This album can be frantic at times but in complete contrast it can also be a goodnight lullaby. I can't really say if fans of previous records will be fond of this album but if you are feeling the monotony of modern music and want something with passion and soul then maybe Migrant is an album you should right click  up next on your playlist.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;

Build a Rocket Boys!	Elbow	Pop/Rock	2011-04-12 00:00:00	Uncut	82.0	In short, it's a quietly beautiful record: anthemic but not bombastic, introspective yet universal, simply drawn but beautifully coloured in. [Apr 2011, p.82]
Work	Shout Out Louds	Rock	2010-02-23 00:00:00	No Ripcord	68.0	This is such a charming little band, such a charming little album that one wants to like it more than it deserves.
Faded Gloryville	Lindi Ortega	Country	2015-08-07 00:00:00	The Independent (UK)	81.0	Lindi Ortega split sessions between Nashville and Muscle Shoals. The result stretches her character in new and intriguing ways, effectively redefining Ortega as a cross between Loretta Lynn and Amy Winehouse.
Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang	Raekwon	Rap	2011-03-08 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	73.0	So, you're a founding member of the legendary hip-hip combo Wu Tang Clan. And your fans are extremely pissed because you went and done a track with that Justin Bieber.
The Afterman: Descension	Coheed and Cambria	Pop/Rock	2013-02-05 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	75.0	For every sledgehammer track, there’s a garlic crusher, destructive in a lightweight and cosmopolitan kind of way.... It’s this lightness of touch and ecleticism that makes the album such a refreshingly undemanding listen.
Brooklyn's Don Diva	Foxy Brown	Rap	2008-05-13 00:00:00	Spin	47.0	Fox gets tripped up by uninspired rap-reggae mashups, electro-pop beats better suited for Nelly Furtado, and rhymes that dwell on designer labels and raunchy sex. [Mar 2008, p.98]
Funeral	Arcade Fire	Indie	2004-09-14 00:00:00	Mojo	90.0	All the components that make the Arcade Fire such a gripping live proposition remain intact on this full-length debut. [Apr 2005, p.96]
B4.DA.$$	Joey Bada$$	Rap	2015-01-20 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	74.0	His official debut LP still sounds like it's stuck in the past, with solid production from old-school legend DJ Premier and his latter-day disciple Statik Selektah.

LateNightTales	Röyksopp	Electronic	2013-06-25 00:00:00	Mixmag	75.0	As cute and quirky as the band themselves, this is instantly up there with LNT mixes from Air and Lindstrøm.
You Have Already Gone to the Other World	A Hawk and a Hacksaw	Pop/Rock	2013-04-02 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	74.0	The playing is astounding throughout, with Barnes and Trost turning a dizzying assemblage of strange instruments into a strikingly cohesive whole.
In The Future	Black Mountain	Indie	2008-01-22 00:00:00	Blender	79.0	More diabolical and daring than the band’s shaggy 2005 debut, Future peaks with the primordial 'Bright Lights.'
Achilles Heel	Pedro The Lion	Indie	2004-05-25 00:00:00	Alternative Press	71.0	A heartbreakingly brilliant album that unravels itself slowly if you just stop and listen. [Jul 2004, p.132]

Standing In The Way Of Control	Gossip	Indie	2006-01-24 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	72.0	The Gossip's melodies are infectious and their beats propulsive enough... to get the sk8er kids to drop the self-conscious posturing and dance a little.

Further	The Chemical Brothers	Electronic	2010-06-22 00:00:00	Urb	70.0	Eclecticism has always been the strength of the Chemical Brothers and with their seventh studio album Further they continue to develop musically.
Tourist	Athlete	Indie	2005-05-10 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	46.0	“Wires” does grow in stature with familiarity through radio exposure, and “Trading Air” could easily have the same kind of airplay success, but I can’t understand the mindset of anyone who’d want to play them over and over again when so many other, more exciting and intriguing things exist.
On Leaving	Nina Nastasia	Indie	2006-10-03 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	76.0	A quintessential collection of the kind of subtle contrasts and ambiguity that makes her such a fascinating songwriter.
Who Me?	Juan Wauters	Pop/Rock	2015-05-12 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	66.0	Who Me?, then, is a weird, loveable record to file alongside Wauters’ labelmate and touring buddy Mac DeMarco.

Invariable Heartache	Kort	Country	2011-04-26 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	79.0	Generally there's not too much straying away from the Nashville sound and Wagner's production keeps things sounding impressively full and remarkably fresh considering the age of the source material.
Howl	The Howlin' Brothers	Country	2013-03-05 00:00:00	Exclaim	74.0	If more attention was paid to crafting better songs, rather than just sounds, Howl would have been much more fulfilling.
No Thrills	Amateur Best	Pop/Rock	2013-02-03 00:00:00	Pitchfork	69.0	It's boldly rendered, and somehow crafts a very human world from cartoon sonics.
The Voyager	Jenny Lewis	Pop/Rock	2014-07-29 00:00:00	Pitchfork	77.0	The Voyager is not quite so easily summed up. It’s not anchored in one particular scene, but plays as broadly California, with sly nods to the Byrds in the guitars, the Go-Go’s in the vocals, and Randy Newman in the wry humor.
Dye It Blonde	Smith Westerns	Pop/Rock	2011-01-18 00:00:00	PopMatters	80.0	The band never merely repeats itself here, creating a record that sounds at once cohesive and loaded with singles. It's a rare feat, and one that usually gets overlooked by critics shooting for the zeitgeist. Good for us that we didn't miss out on this one.
All For You	Janet Jackson	Pop	2001-04-24 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	73.0	But if Jackson tries too hard to meet a standard of sexual frankness that's heightened in the four years since her last outing, she more than delivers her quota of hits.
Does This Look Infected?	Sum 41	Rock	2002-11-26 00:00:00	Launch.com	75.0	Sum 41's second album careens with the impassioned joy of young men less interested in taking the system down than in entertaining their fellow mallrats.
Alopecia	Why?	Indie	2008-03-11 00:00:00	AllMusic	76.0	It displays both crypticness and honesty, intellectualism and vulgarity in equal measure, challenging and placating its audience in the same drawn-out, undefined, nasally breath.

Through The Devil Softly	Hope Sandoval & The Warm Inventions	Rock	2009-09-29 00:00:00	Spin	70.0	To most listeners, though, Through the Devil Softly will simply function as a collection of breathily perfect lullabies.
Crazy World LP	Boys Like Girls	Country	2012-12-11 00:00:00	Absolute Punk (Staff reviews)	41.0	Over and done in less than 45 minutes, Crazy World is a fine album from a band who seems comfortable with their place in the landscape of contemporary music.
Tanglewood Numbers	Silver Jews	Indie	2005-10-18 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	81.0	Musically, he’s ditched the clean, plainly instrumented indie-country schlep of his previous efforts for something brassy, something downright soulful.
False Beats and True Hearts	Damon & Naomi	Pop/Rock	2011-05-17 00:00:00	Filter	71.0	False Beats and True Hearts is a slo-mo crawl through ghostly harmonies, assured and glacial pacing, and the smoking hot psych guitar of Ghost's Michio Kurihara.
John Wesley Harding	Thea Gilmore	Folk	2011-06-28 00:00:00	The Independent (UK)	73.0	"Thea Gilmore's 70th birthday tribute takes the form of re-recording her favourite Dylan album in its entirety, triggered by her acclaimed 2002 cover of ""I Dreamed I Saw St Augustine"", which sustains its solemnity despite the inclusion of congas."
Just A Souvenir	Squarepusher	Indie	2008-10-28 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	66.0	This lengthy offering comes complete with a detailed manifesto about its inspiration. Too bad it reads like your kid brother’s first ’shroom trip.
Rooty	Basement Jaxx	Dance	2001-06-26 00:00:00	Neumu.net	82.0	It's no different from the formula that made Fatboy Slim and the Chemical Bores such big hits, but something's different this time around: Basement Jaxx have soul.
Elephants...Teeth Sinking Into Heart	Rachael Yamagata	Rock	2008-10-07 00:00:00	AllMusic	72.0	The first disc, Elephants, pitches its tent closer to the Happenstance camp with lushly textured ballads, while Teeth Sinking Into Heart plays up the singer's debt to rock artists like PJ Harvey. The latter CD is the biggest surprise here, as it displays a swaggering confidence that wasn't as evident on Yamagata's previous releases.
Kveikur	Sigur Rós	Alternative/Indie Rock	2013-06-18 00:00:00	The Observer (UK)	80.0	The trouble is, much of it still sounds about as vital as Coldplay Babelfished into Icelandic.
Born Again In The USA	Loose Fur	Indie	2006-03-21 00:00:00	PopMatters	72.0	Born Again in the USA is as worthy as side projects get, an album you’d want to pay attention to even if you’d never heard of its antecedents.
M B V	My Bloody Valentine	Pop/Rock	2013-02-02 00:00:00	Exclaim	87.0	Twenty-two years later, My Bloody Valentine is still the band everyone's talking about, and although it may not necessarily build on Loveless, there's no audible reason m b v shouldn't be spoken of in the same hushed, venerating tones.
Wondrous Bughouse	Youth Lagoon	Pop/Rock	2013-03-05 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	74.0	Like the most memorable trips, this one creates some sublime eidetic imagery.
Three's Co.	The Tyde	Indie	2006-08-29 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	62.0	It's consistently catchy, and produced with a broad enough vision so that it doesn't get repetitive.
Music Complete	New Order	Pop/Rock	2015-09-25 00:00:00	Under The Radar	76.0	For the most part, Music Complete is a resounding success. It's an Indian summer of carefree enjoyment and reconnection to what made New Order one of the finest and most innovative bands of the 1980s
Education, Education, Education & War	Kaiser Chiefs	Pop/Rock	2014-04-01 00:00:00	The Telegraph (UK)	59.0	Wilson has nothing wildly original to say about the state of modern Britain, but sounds authentically angry on behalf of people on minimum wage or zero-hours jobs.
Transgender Dysphoria Blues	Against Me!	Pop/Rock	2014-01-21 00:00:00	CMJ	82.0	Through it all, the energy and attitude is unchanged. And although the band’s themes seem even more specifically focused, this album is really for anyone who’s ever felt held back.
Sky Burial	Inter Arma	Pop/Rock	2013-03-19 00:00:00	AllMusic	85.0	This focus on ambience really makes Sky Burial feel like it exists in a very specific, and very secluded, space, and while you probably wouldn't want to live there, it's amazing to visit.
Presents...Here Come the Bombs	Gaz Coombes	Pop/Rock	2012-05-21 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	70.0	With 'Here Come The Bombs', frontman Gaz Coombes does a surprisingly adept job of retaining [former band, Supergrass's] oddball pop sensibility, but shaping it into something that's, if not mature, then at least slightly less frivolously young and free.

Somehow, without her group The Fiery Furnaces, she rocks with a more easyEleanor Friedberger gives us a nice breeze of indie-pop perfection. Somehow, without her group The Fiery Furnaces, she rocks with a more easy freedom. It's very pleasant as it doesn't sound forced as even some of The Fiery Furnaces albums did. These are the kinds of songs that I am looking for big stars like Katy Perry to be writing, but instead they are writing as though they are little girls still in high school. And I'm supposed to be excited by a possible romance between Katy and some other superstar singer. I don't want news of romances and blase music. I just want good music written and sung nicely as Eleanor does on this album.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Lissy Trullie	Lissy Trullie	Pop/Rock	2012-04-10 00:00:00	The Boston Phoenix	61.0	Lissy Trullie sounds simultaneously hungry and tepid, as if Trullie wants to make a big splash, but her album lacks the conviction or vision to make it happen.
Rapprocher	Class Actress	Pop/Rock	2011-10-18 00:00:00	AllMusic	69.0	You'd have to go a long way to hear a better synth pop album, no matter what decade you examine.
Blakroc	Blakroc	Rock	2009-11-27 00:00:00	The Guardian	72.0	Together, they have crafted a succession of enormous, swaggering grooves and mostly ­compelling raps about rock and rap staples such as sex and drugs and cash.
Alegranza	El Guincho	Rock	2008-10-07 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	79.0	It’s hard to know what to make of such attention to individual moments in an album so devoted to the overall spectacle; it’s harder because those privileged moments are spread so sparsely throughout.
Under Great White Northern Lights [Live]	The White Stripes	Rock	2010-03-16 00:00:00	Mojo	78.0	"So unlike ""Raw & Alive"" by The Seeds, say there's no need for overdubbed excitement here, just the Noughties' most smokin' rock'n'roll act, on breathtaking form. [Apr 2010, p.96]"
Based on a True Story...	Blake Shelton	Country	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Billboard.com	64.0	If fans felt like they got to know the real Blake on the hit NBC show, they'll get another close look with this batch of songs.
Icky Thump	The White Stripes	Indie	2007-06-19 00:00:00	Delusions of Adequacy	80.0	With Icky Thump they have proven, yet again, that being musically sound in both songwriting and craftsmanship, while knowing how to exercise instrumentation is key in making a solid album in today’s day and age.
Africa Express Presents...Terry Riley's In C Mali	Africa Express	Folk	2015-01-26 00:00:00	Pitchfork	82.0	Africa Express keeps it to a bite-sized 41 minutes, and every one of them includes something to savor.
Kill For Love	Chromatics	Pop/Rock	2012-03-27 00:00:00	PopMatters	80.0	It's a keeper, a dark passenger for long roads ahead and a heavyweight contender for record of the year.
Go Plastic	Squarepusher	Electronic	2001-06-26 00:00:00	Alternative Press	70.0	Go Plastic fuses the insanely intricate beat programming of Feed Me Weird Things and Daddy with the abstruse experimentation of 1998's Music is Rotted One Note. It's the best of both worlds. [Aug 2001, p.98]
Homesick	Matrixxman	Electronic	2015-07-10 00:00:00	Spin	76.0	There’s no shortage of potential DJ weaponry on Homesick, but what makes the album truly impressive are the cuts where Matrixxman gets out of his presumed comfort zone and steps away from the club.
Maui Tears	Sleepy Sun	Electronic	2014-01-28 00:00:00	The 405	67.0	Each of the nine tracks holds its own.
Hvarf/Heim	Sigur Rós	Rock	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	74.0	Rarely are stopgaps so magisterial, tender, and wistful. But, again, I hope that’s the point.
Mended with Gold	The Rural Alberta Advantage	Pop/Rock	2014-09-30 00:00:00	The Line of Best Fit	74.0	The Rural Alberta Advantage bring enough intelligence and thoughtfulness to their music to ensure that it’ll appeal to listeners who wouldn’t normally like to admit to listening to soaring, emotionally open indie rock.
Lazaretto	Jack White	Pop/Rock	2014-06-10 00:00:00	The 405	80.0	Despite Jack White's claims that each song is separate due to the archive nature of his source material Lazaretto is a cohesive entity made distinct by the range of styles and structural arrangements on individual tracks.
The Outsider	DJ Shadow	Rap	2006-09-19 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	62.0	The cadre of eclectic guest appearances... make it seem like this record would play more like a mix tape, but Shadow pulls it off, and for the most part, each of the guest artists deliver the goods.
Bad as Me	Tom Waits	Pop/Rock	2011-10-25 00:00:00	BBC Music	88.0	While this isn't a great album it's still a very good one, and even lesser Waits is worth a lot in any other currency.
This is PiL	Public Image Ltd.	Pop/Rock	2012-05-29 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	66.0	If lyrically This Is PiL marks a step forward for Lydon, then musically the album seems caught in a mid-'90s production rut, the color and texture of the band's rhythm section feeling leached out.
As I Am	Alicia Keys	R&B;	2007-11-13 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	66.0	Alicia Keys’ third studio album is an exercise in tightening the screws.
Both Sides Of The Gun	Ben Harper	Rock	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	69.0	While his ambition on Both Sides Of The Gun is just another of Harper's many likable qualities, ambition alone doesn't make the kind of statement that the album's scope and structure demands.
Free	Twin Atlantic	Pop/Rock	2011-05-03 00:00:00	Kerrang!	55.0	It's a record so strong that it's hard to single out standout tracks, and even harder to locate points of weakness, and by anyone's standards this is one hell of an achievement. [30 Apr 2011, p.50]
X	Chris Brown	Pop	2014-09-16 00:00:00	Billboard.com	63.0	Once gratuitous fillers are skipped, gems appear, especially on the closing half, where Brown is lucid about his tabloid love life.
Teenage And Torture	Shilpa Ray & Her Happy Hookers	Pop/Rock	2011-01-18 00:00:00	The New York Times	79.0	Ms. Ray isn't shy about unleashing her raspy howl or working up to a shriek. Yet behind all the hollering and the band's frenetic buildups it's not all comedy. Ms. Ray's songs zero in on all the contradictory pressures women face: to be cosmetically perfect but authentic, independent but nurturing, flippant but honest, and more.
Heroes To Zeros	Beta Band	Indie	2004-05-04 00:00:00	Playlouder	74.0	We've rooted for them and been scantly rewarded, but at last they&#146;ve done it - 'Heroes To Zeros&#146; is great and they know it.
Perfect Darkness	Fink	Electronic	2011-07-19 00:00:00	AllMusic	69.0	On Perfect Darkness, Fink sticks to the excellent template he developed around 2006, and in its best moments, the record offers sounds on par with anything off his previous two records: the same taut folky guitar, the same delicate grooves, and the same quiet, reserved vocals all rolled into one laconic, low-key package.
Merriweather Post Pavilion	Animal Collective	Indie	2009-01-20 00:00:00	Sputnikmusic	89.0	Merriweather Post Pavilion is heartbreaking and heartwarming, and you can either disregard what is one of the most pleasing, enjoyably rich and rewarding releases of the past decade or you can rally with the rest of us, and clap, and sing, and blare it through the earphones on your iPod because we are still all the things outside of us.

The Magic Whip	Blur	Pop/Rock	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Pretty Much Amazing	81.0	The Magic Whip continues along the weird and winding path first trod by Blur’s two previous, and most complex, LPs. More often than not, the album meanders, usually for the better.

Feeler	Toadies	Pop/Rock	2010-08-17 00:00:00	Boston Globe	7.8	"It's inexplicable why these songs were deemed weak follow-ups to the Toadies' stellar 1994 debut, as the ""Feeler'' tunes - re-recorded with the band's current lineup - exude the sinister tension of the breakout hits while also branching out into other sonic turf"
Secret, Profane & Sugarcane	Elvis Costello	Country	2009-06-02 00:00:00	No Ripcord	70.0	He is starting to concern me though, since this is the third album in a row that has left me wallowing in mild to severe disappointment.

Dark Arc	Saintseneca	Pop/Rock	2014-04-01 00:00:00	PopMatters	68.0	Some listeners will find this to be powerful rainy-day music, the kind of stuff to get lost in while staring out the window at the rain. Most of us, though, will run out of patience long before the end.
American Twilight	Crime & the City Solution	Pop/Rock	2013-03-26 00:00:00	Magnet	77.0	We find a band tapping into a distinctly American heart of darkness, capturing this nation's descent into partisan chaos and random, endless violence the way only the foreign-born can. [No. 97, p.54]

Woman	Jill Scott	R&B;	2015-07-24 00:00:00	Exclaim	75.0	Whatever Scott has gone through on an emotional level, Woman finds her at a life stage where she seemingly maintains a balance between optimism and pragmatism, a worldly perspective that informs one of her strongest full-length efforts in a minute.
55 Cadillac	Andrew W.K.	Rock	2009-09-08 00:00:00	PopMatters	59.0	55 Cadillac is a vanity project from a man who might never have seemed deep enough to warrant such a thing.

Cage the Elephant has been my favorite band ever since I picked up their second, and my favorite, album ""Thank You, Happy Birthday."" While I believe Melophobia is the worst album they've released, I still thought it was a great album. It took a different turn from the garage punk sound, and made it a more classic indie thing.

Separation Sunday	The Hold Steady	Indie	2005-05-03 00:00:00	Flak Magazine	86.0	It is Finn's particular gift to be able to set the listener smack in the middle of his songs, seeing what he sees, caring about the lives he chronicles. It is the listener's reward to find these stories scored by big, fat monster hooks, and effortless piano-driven melodies.

Honky Tonk	Son Volt	Country	2013-03-05 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	76.0	This recording feels more like a pleasant diversion rather than a necessity.
Let The Blind Lead Those Who Can See But Cannot Feel	Atlas Sound	Indie	2008-02-19 00:00:00	AllMusic	81.0	The album's not faultless: as with Deerhunter, Cox has the tendency to try too hard to be profound, wanting so badly to say something important that he sounds trite and forced, and untrustworthy, but when he's able to forget about conveying some kind of meaning and instead focuses on the actual music, his message--one of pain and love and feeling lost, of trying desperately to understand--is undeniable.
Transfixiation	A Place to Bury Strangers	Pop/Rock	2015-02-17 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	65.0	It's odd that parts of it sound too careful.
The  New Classic	Iggy Azalea	Rap	2014-04-22 00:00:00	The Independent (UK)	56.0	Though neither particularly new nor classic, Iggy Azalea’s debut album proper (following two self-released mixtapes) reveals enough smarts and skills to sustain the Aussie rapper’s momentum.
Parting the Sea Between Brightness and Me	Touche Amore	Pop/Rock	2011-06-07 00:00:00	Sputnikmusic	81.0	Where its cool and dynamic at first, by the time the albums over you get the sense that there was too much, too quickly, and something was certainly lost.

Chat & Business	Ikara Colt	Indie	2002-11-12 00:00:00	Playlouder	74.0	This is a smart LP. From the opening chunder of 'One Note', a mean bass riff and some grade A wittering, their throb is pure and their thrum sweet.
Here Before	The Feelies	Pop/Rock	2011-04-12 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	73.0	If anything, Here Before echoes the pastel colors of 1986's The Good Earth, each song a subtle variant of the next, measured and metronomic. This isn't a first-spin grabber, but if you're as patient as the Feelies have been, it might grow on you.
Neverendless	Cave	Pop/Rock	2011-09-20 00:00:00	PopMatters	73.0	The five-song platter never relents in its stunning and ceaseless need to drive listeners somewhere, anywhere.

I'd venture that that certainly involves as, if not maybe the most, impressive catalog by any working/living artist on the planet (Yo La Tengo is up there too). It's a great traditional monster double album, eclectic, sprawling & impressive in both it's depth & breadth. Since it's release there have been 3 more songs from these sessions that have popped up (1 as a B-side & 2 on soundtrack) & supposedly there is a whole other album's worth, mixed & ready to go- after the next Wilco is released.

Rehearsing My Choir	The Fiery Furnaces	Indie	2005-10-25 00:00:00	ShakingThrough.net	63.0	Rehearsing My Choir is too self-consciously hip to be a twilight reflection on things past and is filled with personal asides only blood relatives can relate to.

The  Budos Band III	The Budos Band	R&B;	2010-08-10 00:00:00	AllMusic	85.0	This third chapter in the Budos Band's legacy is a giant step forward. That said, for band and listener alike, nothing is lost in this gambit; everything just gets deeper and wider and the payoff is nearly immeasurable.
Funhouse	P!nk	Rock	2008-10-28 00:00:00	The New York Times	69.0	Even though Pink oozes disappointment in herself and others, her music mostly fails to keep up.
Greatest Story Ever Told	David Banner	Rap	2008-07-15 00:00:00	The Boston Phoenix	57.0	The Greatest Story would be a stronger statement if it werenâ??t for the conflicting cornerstones of conscientious-rapper soapboxing and standard-issue gangsta themes heâ??s laid at its foundation.
Sugar	The Sunshine Factory	Pop/Rock	2011-12-12 00:00:00	AllMusic	66.0	Sugar does little to contradict the argument that the Sunshine Factory are nothing more than a My Bloody Valentine tribute act, but it's an act they undeniably do very well.
Shine A Light	The Constantines	Indie	2003-08-19 00:00:00	Uncut	83.0	A sinewy mix of punk, dub, soul, good tunes and classic guy-rock. [Mar 2004, p.87]
The Fall	Gorillaz	Electronic	2011-04-19 00:00:00	AllMusic	67.0	The Fall winds up a little ephemeral, its pleasures as fleeting as the scenery passing outside the windows of a tour bus.
Parallax Error Beheads You	Max Tundra	Electronic	2008-11-18 00:00:00	Pitchfork	76.0	It's packed with ideas, some of which work beautifully and some of which are just a joy to hear play out, but most of all, it's still a whole other world of pop music--an absolutely unique, enchanting, and irreplaceable vision of how the stuff can work.
Live at the South Bank	Kieran Hebden	Electronic	2011-11-15 00:00:00	The Wire	77.0	It's more letdown than meltdown, as veteran drummer Steve Reid runs out steam about halfway through disc two. [Dec 2011, p.70]

The Believer	Rhett Miller	Rock	2006-02-28 00:00:00	Village Voice	64.0	"What, besides an extra layer of production syrup, can Believer cuts like ""Ain't That Strange"" and ""Delicate"" offer that almost any Old 97's barn burner can't?"
Bette	Bette Midler	Pop	2000-10-10 00:00:00	Wall of Sound	73.0	Instead of serving up another platter laden with goopy ballads or attempts to revivify '40s swing, Midler sets her sights on more ambitious and varied targets this time, with engaging covers of easygoing soul tunes and a few spicier selections tossed in. The results, while promising, are a mixed bag.
Forever Hasn't Happened Yet	John Doe	Indie	2005-03-22 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	66.0	"The songs are short and demo-quality, and though Doe still can't resist the rote roots-rock classicism that used to be beyond his means, the slapped-around sound of songs like ""Heartless"" and ""Ready"" should thrill longtime fans."
Goon	Tobias Jesso Jr.	Pop/Rock	2015-03-17 00:00:00	DIY Magazine	81.0	Goon is gluttonously full of rich sounds, but it’s the running thread that counts: That voice, and its ability to sing about experiences like they’re universal stories, not a means of self-indulgence.
Kensington Heights	The Constantines	Indie	2008-04-29 00:00:00	Village Voice	76.0	"Kensington Heights, like its predecessor, isn't as fiery as the best moments on the band's inconsistent breakthrough, 2003's ""Shine a Light,"" but the Constantines still deliver bedrock strength and eternal-flame passion."
Anything In Return	Toro y Moi	Electronic	2013-01-22 00:00:00	Pretty Much Amazing	70.0	The brew of Anything In Return is strong enough that its overly sugary moments don’t ruin the experience of the album, and it’s certainly strong enough to merit many, many plays.
Mended with Gold	The Rural Alberta Advantage	Pop/Rock	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Uncut	74.0	There's a haunted, frequently unhinged quality to its songs and performances. [Nov 2014, p.83]
Who You Are	Jessie J	Pop	2011-04-12 00:00:00	The Telegraph (UK)	51.0	This debut switches effortlessly from r&b; ballads to punchy rap tunes. With her big voice and ballsy attitude, is she Ilford's very own Pink?
Nightcrawler	Pete Yorn	Rock	2006-08-29 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	67.0	It's the first album on which the distinctive, likeable laziness of his vocal style seems to have seeped into the production.
Earth Rocker	Clutch	Pop/Rock	2013-03-19 00:00:00	Sputnikmusic	72.0	With a fan-pleasing alteration in style and 'no-filler, all-killer' logic, the outfit have churned out one of the their most widely appealing efforts thus far, not to mention a staple release for stoner rock in 2013.
Popular Problems	Leonard Cohen	Folk	2014-09-23 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	86.0	The backup vocals that seem de rigueur on all Cohen albums are often unnecessary here and at their worst distracting when sung overtop the main attraction.
A Day Without Rain	Enya	Pop	2000-11-21 00:00:00	Sonicnet	41.0	Unfortunately, A Day Without Rain, Enya's first new studio album in five years, lacks the edge that could pry it loose from the New Age niche. The Irish traditional music Enya performed so skillfully in the early 1980s with Clannad has by now largely disappeared in a m&#233;lange of sly, Celtic-flavored pop hooks and muddled mysticism. The only mystery is why it took her so long to come up with something so short (under 35 minutes) -- and, in many spots, so uninspired.
Gang Of Losers	The Dears	Indie	2006-10-03 00:00:00	AllMusic	79.0	They're a little less baroque, they're a little less depressing... but they're just as emotional and affecting, which makes Gang of Losers very good indeed.
Little Joy	Little Joy	Indie	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Los Angeles Times	71.0	Little Joy's charmingly lazy songwriting makes no gesture at becoming anything beyond an excellent dinner-party soundtrack. But in these trying times for art and political life, such warm-hearted mood music will at least make your headaches go away.
Around The Sun	R.E.M.	Rock	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Los Angeles Times	56.0	A noncommittal aura undermines Michael Stipe's most personal, poetic and moving set of lyrics in years. [3 Oct 2004]
Morning Phase	Beck	Pop/Rock	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Pitchfork	81.0	Not only does it uphold the myths of baby boomer greats like the Byrds, Neil Young, and Simon and Garfunkel with a staid type of reverence, but it also piggybacks on the legacy of one of Beck's best records. It's the sound of a rule-breaker dutifully coloring inside the lines.
In the Lonely Hour	Sam Smith	Pop	2014-06-17 00:00:00	PopMatters	62.0	Where Smith will follow his muse next is anyone’s guess, but for now, his talent is a clear force to be reckoned with and his debut is ripe with promise.

Oblivion With Bells	Underworld	Pop	2007-10-16 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	64.0	Oblivion With Bells is less the comedown than the sound of the party still going 10 years on.

Primrose Green	Ryley Walker	Pop/Rock	2015-03-31 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	83.0	He has an uncanny feel for the triangulation of folk, jazz and blues that came from the fleet fingers of Bert Jansch and John Fahey back in the ’60s.
El Turista	Josh Rouse	Rock	2010-03-09 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	75.0	It also, sadly, carries on Rouse’s newfound emphasis on pleasant textures over passion and songcraft. Rouse never settles into any of these styles; he’s just breezing through.
James Pants	James Pants	Electronic	2011-05-03 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	72.0	Too many of these tracks sound like empty afterthoughts, or half-baked studio incarnations, needing more embellishment or maybe just a general reimagining.
After the Disco	Broken Bells	Pop/Rock	2014-02-04 00:00:00	Pretty Much Amazing	71.0	Taken solely as part of the Broken Bells discography it’s their best effort yet: a textured, kaleidoscopic pop record that crackles with imagination, and hints at the sign of something brilliant to come.
Alligator	The National	Indie	2005-04-12 00:00:00	AllMusic	82.0	[A] fine collection of city-weary poetry.
Aftershock	Motörhead	Pop/Rock	2013-10-22 00:00:00	Pitchfork	78.0	The majority of the record is a classic ride-or-die Motörhead proposition, punctuated with just the right amount of breathing room.
The First Days Of Spring	Noah and the Whale	Rock	2009-10-06 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	71.0	They have done a hell of a lot of growing up. An immense album.
The Chaos	The Futureheads	Rock	2010-06-01 00:00:00	Clash Music	77.0	An ever present Gang of Four musical demeanor, and the untiring pace of Fugazi makes 'The Chaos' quite aptly relentless.
Morning Phase	Beck	Pop/Rock	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Clash Music	81.0	Morning Phase is a return to the lovelorn introspection of 2002’s ‘Sea Change’--in style, if not substance.

All of the songs (except maybe Da Vinci) are songs only Weezer can make. There is a sincerity here that has not been apparent in their previous couple of releases. Stand out tracks are Ain't Got Nobody, Lonely Girl, I've Had it Up to Here, The British Are Coming, and Foolish Father.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Loma Vista	Family of the Year	Pop/Rock	2012-07-10 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	78.0	Melodies bristle, harmonies surge, hooks fly dense as bullets in The Raid and Joe Keefe's lush stoner vocals trace out stories of neighbour-annoying hedonism, missing home and boozing and rocking all the way to the afterlife. Fun-drenched.
Ghosts	Monolake	Electronic	2012-03-13 00:00:00	Exclaim	84.0	Ghosts is the thinking electronic music fan's subtler and more paranoid alternative to Amon Tobin's brick-smashing A/V opus, ISAM.
Perfect Symmetry	Keane	Rock	2008-10-14 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	64.0	Unfortunately, Perfect Symmetry is an album characterized by its heavy-handedness, so while it sounds as though the band was aiming for Echo & the Bunnymen, they hit Duran Duran or Simple Minds instead, making for a brand new record that often sounds badly dated.
Holy Ghost!	Holy Ghost!	Electronic	2011-04-26 00:00:00	The New York Times	69.0	The group--mainly the keyboardist and singer Alex Frankel and the drummer Nick Millhiser, childhood friends from the Upper West Side--brings the same uncorked enthusiasm to its self-titled debut.
The Singles Collection 2001-2011	Gorillaz	Rap	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Expert Witness (MSN Music)	76.0	Their synthbeat-meets-comi&#8203;x concept got over as pop because it found a mildly playful and pleasurable way to enact well-meaning self-effacement.

Beauty Behind the Madness	The Weeknd	R&B;	2015-08-28 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	74.0	He may have softened his edge, upped the production and pulled in the stars, but The Weeknd remains an outsider.
Boys & Girls	Alabama Shakes	Pop/Rock	2012-04-10 00:00:00	No Ripcord	76.0	Perhaps ... the best way to describe Boys & Girls: unwilling to innovate or add anything new to its genre, preferring to remind us of the roots of rock instead of showing us what made the pioneers so great, a reminder of a past love instead of a new love for us to discover.
No Mythologies to Follow	MØ	Electronic	2014-03-11 00:00:00	CMJ	76.0	With No Mythologies To Follow, MØ has established herself within an emerging circle of powerful pop dominatrixes but with her own distinct sound full of versatility and vitality.
Pe'ahi	The Raveonettes	Pop/Rock	2014-07-22 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	75.0	If Pe’ahi is a tribute to Sune’s father, it’s a warts-and-all portrayal of a turbulent relationship, but one delivered with a tenderness and intensity that propels the very concept of the retro garage duo into a fresh sonic stratosphere. Drop in, it’s an exhilarating descent.
Communicate	Sasha & John Digweed	Dance	2000-05-23 00:00:00	Revolution	53.0	Much like on their previous US release, Northern Exposure 3, Communicate witnesses Sasha and Digweed stringing together some of trance's more delicate and subdued tracks, but this time with more variety and dancefloor sensibility. [Sept. 2000, p.110]
Gulag Orkestar	Beirut	Indie	2006-05-09 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	80.0	Beirut's mournful horn riffs, driving piano, sprightly ukulele, dense percussion and occasional synth loops proved haunting and entrancing at best, flat-out morose at worst, and benignly pretty the rest of the time.
Kaleide	Sky Larkin	Rock	2010-08-10 00:00:00	Clash Music	69.0	Kaleide works best when all of its individual fragments twist into vision as one.
...Featuring Norah Jones	Norah Jones	Jazz	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	68.0	Singing with El Madmo or sampled by Talib Kweli, she doesn't sit comfortably or confidently in every style, but even the less successful forays serve to bust through genre boundaries.
Doubled Exposure	D. Charles Speer & the Helix	Country	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	76.0	This is a record you could play on the car stereo whilst burning up the miles on the Tennessee interstate, and it’d never sound wrong.
An Invitation	Inara George With Van Dyke Parks	Rock	2008-08-12 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	73.0	The album's light-fantastic orchestration, courtesy of famed songwriter and composer Parks , is equally delightfully old-fashioned--though George's decidedly contemporary lyrics recall the arch-baroque confessionals of Rufus Wainwright and Fiona Apple. [15 Aug 2008, p.67]
I Love You	Amanda Blank	Rap	2009-08-04 00:00:00	Sputnikmusic	59.0	Blank by the numbers, blank’s the result.
Long Line of Heartaches	Connie Smith	Country	2011-08-19 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	73.0	Long Line of Heartaches should earn her a place alongside genre vets like Loretta Lynn and Johnny Cash, whose late-career albums have ranked among their strongest work.
Benji	Sun Kil Moon	Pop/Rock	2014-02-11 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	85.0	Kozelek’s lack of reservation here is something to be begrudgingly admired, as his willingness to make yet another album that is solely for himself and those obsessive fans who want all the gory details of his past. For the rest of the world, there’s not much here to make any real connection with.
Let It Beard	Boston Spaceships	Pop/Rock	2011-08-02 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	71.0	Let It Beard might be the weirdest but most original album of the year.
Bleach: Deluxe Edition	Nirvana	Rock	2009-11-03 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	85.0	Sure, it’s valuable as a blueprint for music that would change everything (for a while, anyway), but also as a repository for the perfect synthesis of grunge’s anger and Kurt Cobain’s pop sensibility.
The Concretes	The Concretes	Indie	2004-06-29 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	75.0	The staccato horns and guitar drones bathed in Wall of Gloom reverb provide just enough warmth to ward off frostbite. [23 Jul 2004, p.77]
MeYouWeYou	Rocketnumbernine	Electronic	2013-07-29 00:00:00	Resident Advisor	80.0	This is a perfectly fine debut, but probably nothing compared to seeing them live.

I honestly never thought I would ever say this but I could barely listen to all of the songs from beginning to end. I literally had to skip every song, and I couldn't help but hope that the next one would be amazing so I wouldn't feel so bad.Before Mobile Orchestra I would never say anything like that, there was no ""Oh wow I don't like this song at all"" while I was listening to any of his songs, and I mean all of them, including the ones from his other projects. I'm so confused and upset because Adam Young is so talented, I truly can't understand what happened.To be honest, not all of the songs were actually bad. The gospel ones were the best, but the lyrics. -and before I say anything else: I respect that Adam is a religious person, even though I'm not. I have no interest in any religion, and I'm not the type of person who would say bad things about any religion or judge Adam or anyone for their beliefs - I just couldn't relate to the lyrics and It actually annoyed me, so unfortunately I couldn't listen to those songs either.I completely understand and accept that people change and that Adam Young has changed a lot. As an artist he will inevitably change his music all the time, just like he has done before. From Ocean Eyes to The Midsummer Station every track was different, but each one was still great you know?With all being said, what I feel about this album couldn't change what I feel about Adam Young at all, I still love him and admire him with all my heart. I honestly can't believe I've said all of this and I feel so bad, I'm literally gonna listen to Ocean Eyes now for 3 days straight, excuse me&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"

First Love	Emmy the Great	Rock	2009-02-09 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	74.0	Laura Marling, six years Emmy’s junior, sounds far more worldly wise, and there’s a sense of naivety, rather than innocence, that stops the album being as Joni Mitchell as it thinks it is.

The Violence	Darren Hayman & the Long Parliament	Pop/Rock	2012-11-05 00:00:00	The Quietus	81.0	Autumnal, witty, sad, lovely and very, very English The Violence is the high watermark of Hayman's career and one of the finest British releases of 2012, a record that neither floats, nor drowns, but soars.

I'm not going to say anything nasty about The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart.  They are a good band and are nice people and play a good live show (and one of my friends is an old roommate of singer Kip Berman), etc.  TPOBPAH also made me wonder if we weren't entering into a surprise tweepop millennium when their eponymous full length gained its original megahype.  Campesinos! aside, The Pains were really our new twee masters in 2008/9.  But Belong is in no way the record the eponymous LP was.  Especially coming off the extraordinary high water mark of the Higher Than The Stars 12"" (specifically the digital only remixes of the songs).  What happened?  I've suspended judgment for more than a year.  The results are that I can now stomach the excessive production values and guitar crunch (feedback, fuzz, reverb = good; Smashing Pumpkins, 1995 crunch = not good).  I can handle the essential sameness of the songs (all the B-Sides from the first full length were equally same-y).  But while the eponymous LP made me euphoric and wistful for fuzzy Britpop, Belong makes me remember how out of place dream pop was when it would spring up randomly in the 90s. (Belong's title track sounds more than a little like Primitive Radio Gods's ""Standing In A Broken Phone Booth..."" I know it's incidental.  Still...  It does.)  But, all crankiness and feelings of betrayal aside, Beyond (the album, not the song) grows on you after a year.  I'm not mad or hurt anymore.  Moreover, I'm confident TPOBPAH can reprise their initial burst of momentum, break this sophomore slump, and release a great third album when the time comes.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"

The introversion and existentialism of""Dream River"" feels like a fulfillment of 2011's ""Apocalypse,"" in both sound and sentiment. The introversion and existentialism of ""Apocalypse"" has resolved into contentment and personal outreach, and its backing musicians return sounding fuller and more vibrant. ""Javelin Unlanding"" quivers with energy, setting the flutes of ""Apocalypse"" amidst echoing vocals and galloping hand percussion. Guitarist Matt Kinsey brings melodic life Callahan's words, rising to a distorted climax during the sexual pleas of ""Spring"" and evoking an approaching storm midway through ""Summer Painter."" Bill's own emergence may start tentatively  he's come out from reckoning with his demo tapes on the hotel bed from ""Riding for the Feeling"" to seek company in the lobby bar on ""The Sing,"" only to find (in true Callahan fashion) all of its patrons asleep. Yet by ""Small Plane"" he is sharing the controls with a partner and lifting off the ground with ease, as fingerpicked electric guitars update the contemplative drift of ""Riding."" Yet it's slide-guitar lead that hearkens back furthest, to 1997's ""To Be of Use"", a context that lends his closing observation ""I really am a lucky man"" a feeling of hard-won reward. Though its range-y sound and dream-logic structure may put it behind 2009's ""Sometimes I Wish We Were an Eagle"" in terms of memorable songs, it's the way ""Dream River"" progresses so gracefully from the quietly brilliant ""Apocalypse"" that earns its stature among his best work.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"

With this LP Mimi really brings the levity, also the fun and the essence of her previous work. Her most dance an ""poppy"" sound displays a more concentrated Mariah and multiple collaborations. This mix of club jams and power ballads shows the real hitmaker of the 90's. The natural lyrics seems like it was Mariah's diary, it's a personal one, even though it seems -at the same time- too risky and fabricated for mainstream but at the end we have a enjoyable material and that's a fact.Highlights: I Stay In Love, For The Record, Touch My Body.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"

Delta Spirit	Delta Spirit	Pop/Rock	2012-03-13 00:00:00	AllMusic	69.0	Even if there's nothing inherently new about the band's take on rock, and at times they seem too comfortable coasting on trends from the mid-2000s, Delta Spirit manage to convey a likeable sound that is strong and intimate at the same time.
Honeymoon	Lana Del Rey	Pop/Rock	2015-09-18 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	79.0	Whereas her last album had a gently psychedelic and live-off-the-floor feel, Honeymoon plays it safer with “cinematic” arrangements occasionally pumped up (but not excessively so) with modern drum sounds.

Mourning in America and Dreaming in Color	Brother Ali	Rap	2012-09-18 00:00:00	Mojo	80.0	For all its survivalist blues and everyman politicking, Mourning really connects when the Ali gets up close and personal. [Oct 2012, p.89]
Divine Ecstasy	Supreme Cuts	Electronic	2014-01-28 00:00:00	The New York Times	68.0	Vertigo is still clearly the goal of tracks that loop and layer and pile on speedily pattering percussion, deliberately occluding vocalists who are busy emoting and elaborating.
Melody's Echo Chamber	Melody's Echo Chamber	Pop/Rock	2012-09-25 00:00:00	Under The Radar	79.0	Stereolab, Cocteau Twins, and Broadcast are key reference points here, though Prochet ensures that the only voice you'll recognize in the Chamber is hers.
Xscape	Michael Jackson	R&B;	2014-05-13 00:00:00	The Observer (UK)	66.0	It's an understandably ad hoc collection that conjures up snatches of wonder from scraps of genius.
Rockin' The Suburbs	Ben Folds	Rock	2001-09-11 00:00:00	Sonicnet	75.0	The new Ben Folds is a lot like the old one: as unpredictable as he is talented.
Fading Parade	Papercuts	Pop/Rock	2011-03-01 00:00:00	Filter	71.0	Papercuts' fourth album and Sub Pop debut, Fading Parade, is nothing like this overwrought, overwhelming assault on the senses.
Friend And Foe	Menomena	Indie	2007-01-23 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	78.0	Now that Menomena's technique feels less jarring and daring, though, the group has done a decent job of pouring its euphoric weirdness into bruised, beautiful songcraft.
Daughter of Cloud	Of Montreal	Pop/Rock	2012-10-23 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	65.0	While Daughter of Cloud houses a number of Barnes' most flamboyantly weird musical ideas, they're also frequently some of his hollowest.
These Days...	Ab-Soul	Rap	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	70.0	That Ab-Soul tries to do both makes for a pretty entertaining ride, even when he technically falters. Ambition changes the definition of success, making this Ab-Soul record a better experience that can be picked apart.

At The Cut	Vic Chesnutt	Rock	2009-09-22 00:00:00	Mojo	80.0	A more effective synergy arrives as the musicians rein in the melodrama, proffering a subtler, shimmering folk rock canvas for Chesnutt's emotional daubings. [Nov 2009, p.91]
Mail On Sunday	Flo Rida	Rap	2008-03-18 00:00:00	Billboard	54.0	His hooks can be rock-solid ('Ack Like You Know') and his interest in gleaming synthesizerism (opener 'American Superstar' comes into 'Tubular Bells' territory, really) helps set him off from the legions of rappers clawing over each other to break out of the South.

Nursing Home	Let's Wrestle	Pop/Rock	2011-05-17 00:00:00	The Boston Phoenix	74.0	The production from Steve Albini ensures that it's not too slick or processed. These short, humble pop songs amble along like the Wedding Present if David Gedge had a wrist injury that cut his inhuman strumming speed in half.

Empire	GRMLN	Pop/Rock	2013-06-04 00:00:00	AllMusic	63.0	While even those fond of the '90s revival may be close to overdosing on nostalgia, Empire offers a fresh enough take to make it worth a listen.
Song Yet To Be Sung	Perry Farrell	Rock	2001-07-17 00:00:00	Mixer	60.0	Lots of rock stars have proclaimed their kinship for DJ culture, but Perry Farrell's passion seems to be one of the more genuine. [Jul 2001, p.82]
100th Window	Massive Attack	Electronic	2003-02-11 00:00:00	Almost Cool	75.0	The problem is that it's just not very engaging, treading the same cinematic-heavy soundscapes over and over again without much in the way of dynamics or anything new in terms of sound.
Where You Live	Tracy Chapman	Rock	2005-09-13 00:00:00	RobB	71.0	Nice music, good lyrics, but not an absolute MUST hear...
III	Eat Skull	Pop/Rock	2013-02-19 00:00:00	Pitchfork	68.0	What was once alienating and difficult in Eat Skull’s music now reads as interesting quirks attached to pleasing packages. With III, Eat Skull is willing to be loved--and be loveable, too.
The Greatest Hits	Foo Fighters	Rock	2009-11-03 00:00:00	j30	85.0	It's hard to rate a greatest hits album.

Neighborhoods	Blink-182	Pop/Rock	2011-09-27 00:00:00	AllMusic	69.0	Perhaps blink could stand to sharpen their words but it's better that they concentrated on their music, creating a fairly ridiculous yet mildly compelling prog-punk spin on the suburbs here.
Come Around Sundown	Kings of Leon	Pop/Rock	2010-10-19 00:00:00	Los Angeles Times	64.0	With its redemptive sins, Come Around Sundown ends up being a portrait of light and dark worthy of the rock and roll bible.
Battle Studies	John Mayer	Rock	2009-11-17 00:00:00	No Ripcord	64.0	Instead of the dynamic sound Mayer is capable of, he has instead continued along the same nicely-paved road he has ridden his whole studio career, a path that has always elicited the same reaction from this writer – a shrug.
The Odd Couple	Gnarls Barkley	Rap	2008-03-18 00:00:00	Lost At Sea	76.0	While the production values on the album are stronger, so is The Odd Couple's focus on Cee-Lo's voice.
Out Among the Stars	Johnny Cash	Country	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	69.0	While the results are neither as energetic and original as the peak Sun Records or Columbia recordings, nor as darkly compelling as the Rubin albums, they’re still a lot better than anyone might have expected.
Mine Is Yours	Cold War Kids	Pop/Rock	2011-01-25 00:00:00	PopMatters	55.0	Willett pledges his love in the face of obstacles in the same way that the guitars get loud in a Nickelback song. It passes for emotion in the absence of anything spontaneous or unrehearsed.
Functional Arrhythmias	Steve Coleman & the Five Elements	Jazz	2013-03-26 00:00:00	BBC Music	81.0	This is the most exciting and substantial Coleman release of the last few years, rigorously challenging, pumped with insinuating melodies, sleek with propulsive energies and pulsating with a uniquely globular funkiness.
What a Terrible World, What a Beautiful World	The Decemberists	Pop/Rock	2015-01-20 00:00:00	The Guardian	77.0	It’s another fantastic, emotional album from a band taking heartfelt stock of where they’ve been and who they are.

The Embers of Time	Josh Rouse	Pop/Rock	2015-04-07 00:00:00	American Songwriter	76.0	Rouse uses his recent psychoanalysis sessions to question universal questions of our place in life as we age. That he does so with such beautifully crafted, hummable pop songs is a testament to his long established talents as one of America’s more overlooked singer/songwriters.
The  Gathering	Arbouretum	Pop/Rock	2011-02-15 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	75.0	The Gathering is weighted in every way, heavy with distortion-crusted guitars, sluggish tempos and an earnest, perhaps even over-earnest, search for meaning.

Pearl Mystic	Hookworms	Pop/Rock	2013-04-02 00:00:00	The Line of Best Fit	77.0	Pearl Mystic is a promising debut from Hookworms, but whether it’s universally appealing is impugnable--there’s a suspicion that accessibility is not exactly on the top of Hookworms’ priorities; instead making interesting, immersive music to get lost in clearly is.
We Are A & C	Arling & Cameron	Indie	2001-08-07 00:00:00	Launch.com	63.0	Arling & Cameron continue to cook up a unique and effervescent blend of European electro pop and future/retro lounge exotica all sprinkled with a computer-calculated dose of kitsch.
MAYA	M.I.A.	Electronic	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	68.0	"While some songs appear to have a cleaner polish (the pleasantly danceable ""XXXO"" and the epic ""Tell Me Why"") than others (the freewheeling ""Born Free"" and the ultra-compressed ""Space""), every song is structured like a concise pop song with just a few rough edges."
Tha Last Meal	Snoop Dogg	Rap	2000-12-19 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	65.0	Make no mistake, this is a poor, poor album.... Frustratingly, it's a waste of talent. For Snoop has lined up an array of musical back-up here (Swizz Beats, Timbaland, Eve, Master P: all marshalled by Dr Dre), and his is one of the most distinctive voices in rap, but he chooses simply to repeat himself with it.
Mama, I'm Swollen	Cursive	Indie	2009-03-10 00:00:00	Sputnikmusic	65.0	Kasher still embraces his flaws and while that may not work to the record's advantage when it does Cursive hits hard as ever.
Kala	M.I.A.	Rap	2007-08-21 00:00:00	Almost Cool	87.0	Like her debut, Kala is somewhat inconsistent, for slightly different reasons. While there isn't the distraction of short tracks and skits to break the flow, some of the songs essentially do the same thing by shooting high and missing the mark.

I Have Hands	The Bran Flakes	Indie	2009-02-24 00:00:00	PopMatters	61.0	I Have Hands would make an excellent primer for anyone wishing to experience the joy that can come from mixing sounds together.

Ski Mask	Islands	Pop/Rock	2013-09-17 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	70.0	There's much to admire here, but when you’ve stared into the sun for too long, it’s hard to see the dimmer lights.
Christ Illusion	Slayer	Rock	2006-08-08 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	72.0	Christ Illusion is not a throwback; it's something new steeped in something old.

Run Rabbit Run	Osso	Rock	2009-10-06 00:00:00	AllMusic	78.0	The resulting Run Rabbit Run dutifully re-creates its creator's hypnotic, quirky, and oddly sweet song cycle, and peppers it with enough dissonant bow slides and odd harmonics to please the avant-garde crowd while keeping the twee melodies intact for the casual indie pop fan.
Move Way [EP]	dBridge	Electronic	2013-08-12 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	70.0	Although everything here is at drum-and-bass tempo, White approaches each track from wildly different directions.
Viet Cong	Viet Cong	Pop/Rock	2015-01-20 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	77.0	Viet Cong hardly shy away from evoking that tragedy, and at times they seem to still be processing its long-term impact.
The January EP	Here We Go Magic	Pop/Rock	2011-05-10 00:00:00	Pitchfork	73.0	"There are still a couple of puzzling decisions--""Backwards Time"" is such a pitch-perfect evocation of the Police that it's actually distracting--but The January EP succeeds where the other Here We Go Magic releases have mostly failed; instead of handing you a couple of shiny baubles, it provides you with an inviting headspace to fall into."
Farm	Dinosaur Jr.	Rock	2009-06-23 00:00:00	JorgeD	76.0	Simply magical album. All the boys bands out there look flaccid against these forty somethings.
Catacombs	Cass McCombs	Indie	2009-07-07 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	76.0	Catacombs isn’t an exception to or refinement of what McCombs has done previously, just a soft demurral of the singer-songwriter career arc.
Send	Wire	Rock	2003-04-28 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	84.0	Forget the new school of post-punk bands. None of them approach the intensity and rhythmic engagement of Wire, still flying the pink flag of twisted rock after all these years.

Wonder Where We Land	SBTRKT	Electronic	2014-10-07 00:00:00	The Guardian	71.0	A$AP Ferg is blithe and funny, while Raury’s endurance flow is impeccably weighted. But SBTRKT still doesn’t gel with songwriting.
Electronic Projects for Musicians	The Apples In Stereo	Indie	2008-04-01 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	68.0	Screwed together with fuzz-tone bridges, rhymes scan monosyllabic even when they’re not, and are resolutely and nostalgically pre-postmodern in their references.
Ronnie Dunn	Ronnie Dunn	Country	2011-06-07 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	70.0	In solo mode following a two-decade stint with Brooks & Dunn, the country star sticks to what he knows: road songs, love songs, songs about how every once in a while you've gotta drink enough whiskey to kill a horse.

Alright, Still	Lily Allen	Rock	2007-01-30 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	79.0	"The production on tracks like ""Shame For You"" and ""Alfie"" is fantastic, and there are plenty of catchy melodies and clever samples, but Allen is a poser who lacks charisma, bites off of everyone else, and is so sickeningly contemptuous of everyone but herself that it makes the pretty, melancholy piano-and-drum-loop ballad ""Littlest Things"" seem like a farce."
Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors	Big Boi	Rap	2012-12-11 00:00:00	The Quietus	72.0	Without a single in sight, even by Outkast's loosey-goosey standards, Vicious Lies and Dangerous Rumors feels like three or four different records surgically stitched together illicitly by some cross-eyed back alley quack.

Driving Towards the Daylight	Joe Bonamassa	Pop/Rock	2012-05-22 00:00:00	The Independent (UK)	70.0	He fills the Gary Moore-shaped hole in the world admirably.
Robyn	Robyn	Rock	2008-04-29 00:00:00	Village Voice	86.0	Her appeal is questionable when she tries to sound like an American rapper, but on tracks where she just sings--the immaculate junk symphony of 'Be Mine,' the excellently Japanese 'Bum Like You,' the Autobahn power-ballad 'With Every Heartbeat'--she gives Europop a swift Swedish energy and presence.
Midnite Vultures	Beck	Rock	1999-11-16 00:00:00	AllMusic	83.0	Musically, Midnite Vultures is filled with wonderful little quirks, but these are undercut by the sneaking suspicion that for all the ingenuity, it's just a hipster joke.
Fifty Shades of Grey [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]	Various Artists	R&B;	2015-02-10 00:00:00	The Telegraph (UK)	65.0	Crazy In Love aside, this generically pleasant and wafty album makes a better accompaniment to laundering sheets than rolling in (or being tied up with) them.
Some Cities	Doves	Rock	2005-03-01 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	72.0	Some Cities builds on the band's propensity for melodic grandeur and achieves pure sonic bliss in the bargain.

An End Has A Start	Editors	Indie	2007-07-17 00:00:00	Urb	65.0	It appears they have emulated themselves on their sophomore (and sophomoric sounding) effort.

Gloss Drop	Battles	Pop/Rock	2011-06-07 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	79.0	Battles is, first and foremost, an instrumental group, but the tracks on Gloss Drop that do feature a guest vocalist are the undisputable highlights.

White Noise	Alpinestars	Rock	2003-02-25 00:00:00	Q Magazine	62.0	Draws heavily on Depeche Mode and the Pet Shop Boys.... It would take a dazzling collection to sound anything other than a poor relation to such synth titans, and this plainly isn't it. [July 2002, p.108]
(III)	Crystal Castles	Electronic	2012-11-13 00:00:00	Q Magazine	76.0	[Glass's] lyrics are often buried in the mix, but no amount of production occultation can hide the fact that the likes of Plague are excelsior anthems for the End Times. [Jan 2013, p.103]

Dark Days/Light Years	Super Furry Animals	Indie	2009-04-21 00:00:00	Dot Music	84.0	On Dark Days/Light Years, their ninth album, The Furries consolidate their best ideas--electro leanings, hypnotic motorik excursions, catchy, hook-driven riffs and layers of vocal melodies.
JackInABox	Turin Brakes	Indie	2005-06-07 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	62.0	Turin Brakes’ expansive and more daring previous work held an encouraging arc that promised risks and excitement, but JackInABox, while a pleasant listen, fails to cash in on that potential, and is unfortunately a step back for the talented duo.
Weapons	Lostprophets	Pop/Rock	2012-06-19 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	56.0	But as a big comeback for these Welsh titans, it's more lost than prophecy...
Empire	Kasabian	Indie	2006-09-19 00:00:00	Los Angeles Times	65.0	It may not be fair to rag on the group for picking the wrong decade to rip off, but right now Kasabian's allegiance to the '90s sounds especially uninspired.
Punish, Honey	Vessel	Electronic	2014-09-16 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	81.0	Punish, Honey moves forward powered by the tension between what it keeps hidden and what little it shows.

Universal Mind Control	Common	Rap	2008-12-09 00:00:00	Vibe	53.0	In fact, the flair that is championed on most Common albums is absent, leaving a vapid display of good ideas with unenthused delivery. This nonchalance has placed Universal Mind Control’s release, regardless of its intentions, in poor form, doing little for progressing Common’s ability.
The Grand Tour	Land Observations	Pop/Rock	2014-07-29 00:00:00	The Wire	73.0	Brooks builds eight neat instrumentals from gradually layer guitar, playing in a closed circle with himself, a dialogue that is sometimes affecting but more often banal. [Aug 2014, p.59]
The Antidote	Morcheeba	Electronic	2005-09-27 00:00:00	PopMatters	64.0	The downside to all of this newfound strength is that it seems that the Godfrey brothers have painted themselves into a rut with this vocalist. By focusing all of their efforts into playing to her strengths, they have eschewed most of the variety of their earlier work.
Spokes	Plaid	Electronic	2003-11-04 00:00:00	Mojo	72.0	Their best in years. [Dec 2003, p.118]

Sounds from Nowheresville	The Ting Tings	Pop/Rock	2012-03-13 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	52.0	The unfortunate irony is that Sounds From Nowheresville doesn't sound much like a grand rejection of pop music at all. It just sounds a little bereft of ideas, and way too short.
OFF!	OFF!	Pop/Rock	2012-05-08 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	75.0	These 16 songs in 16 minutes are a lean demonstration of hardcore punk purity that only lacks memorable songs.

Sunny Day was always about intense emotion felt loud and true through Enigk&#039;s god-searching songwriting. Little has change hear, but for most of the songs the volume has been turned down. And you know what, it is just as good as one or two of the sunny day albums (and it completely eclipses the lackluster fire theft effort from a few years back). Return of the Frog queen was a 10, such a weird, gorgeous album. This is a nine because it is not weird. It is just gorgeous and sometimes, that is okay.

All About Chemistry	Semisonic	Rock	2001-03-13 00:00:00	Launch.com	69.0	Finally, a near-perfect pop disc from Minneapolis's Semisonic. While the band has always hinted it had the right stuff to deliver a truly great record, Chemistry is the first of the band's three releases to make good on the promise.
Coaster	NOFX	Rock	2009-04-28 00:00:00	AllMusic	67.0	As a whole, it's not one of their best records, considering the size of their discography, but it's not a bad little record. Fans will like it since the band is still shining as a tight unit and hasn't lost a step musically.
Now Here Is Nowhere	Secret Machines	Indie	2004-05-18 00:00:00	PopMatters	80.0	They are also the rare psychedelic band who keep to the point -- there are no digressions into noodly space jams to obscure the way.

Living Legend	Gunplay	Rap	2015-07-31 00:00:00	HipHopDX	68.0	While his long journey has finally paid off, Living Legend lacks it factor to have listeners clamoring for a follow-up anytime soon.
MAYA	M.I.A.	Electronic	2010-07-13 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	68.0	MAYA, M.I.A.'s third and so obviously worst album, is the sound of a devoted audience getting f***ed over by a musical sociopath.
Neck of the Woods	Silversun Pickups	Pop/Rock	2012-05-08 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	69.0	It could be a blurry Xerox of old sounds, but singer-guitarist Brian Aubert infuses his songs with wispy drama, balancing moppy-haired brooding and bright, bracing fuzz-drunk melodies.
Mwng	Super Furry Animals	Rock	2000-06-20 00:00:00	Dot Music	84.0	'Mwng' or 'Mane' (as in horses) is a purely Welsh language album and is a theoretically disorientating and complex, but triumphantly audacious, experience.
Beg For Mercy	G-Unit	Rap	2003-11-14 00:00:00	Splendid	62.0	Rarely has rampant misogyny and self-hype sounded as fantastic as this.
Seeds	TV on the Radio	Pop/Rock	2014-11-17 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	78.0	Seeds reflects a band unconcerned with challenging its listeners this time and more interested in delivering a complete collection of competent, mark-bearing songs for the sake of proudly stating the existence of TV On The Radio in 2014.
Around The Sun	R.E.M.	Rock	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Billboard	56.0	The band's writing stagnates, rendering the majority of the album in a rote midtempo formula that Stipe's increasingly trite lyrics can't always save.
The House of Gold and Bones, Vol. 1	Stone Sour	Pop/Rock	2012-10-22 00:00:00	AllMusic	79.0	This is an album that can easily be enjoyed for the songs alone, so while you don't necessarily need to sit down with the liner notes (which include an accompanying story written Corey Taylor) to enjoy the album, it does add an extra layer of narrative action that reveals House of Gold & Bones to be an album of surprising depth.
Double Jointer	Golden Triangle	Rock	2010-03-02 00:00:00	Pitchfork	69.0	While most of Double Jointer's tracks are at least good, the band doesn't tap into that spirit often enough, and ultimately it leaves the album feeling a bit flat.
Vol. 2	Wooden Shjips	Rock	2010-03-30 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	76.0	Wooden Shjips obviously aren’t interested in the same progressive spirit as the likes of fellow travellers Oneida but they’re still damn effective at what they do.
Expo 86	Wolf Parade	Rock	2010-06-29 00:00:00	The Guardian	75.0	Expo 86 is both smart and dense enough to warrant your attention.
Day I Forgot	Pete Yorn	Rock	2003-04-15 00:00:00	TheScientist	58.0	If you like Pete, you&#039;ll like the cd, its more upbeat but unfortunately with less differentiable songs.
Human After All	Daft Punk	Electronic	2005-03-15 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	57.0	Thematically, it's stale and preachy, but few capture mechanized emotion like Daft Punk. [Apr/May 2005, p.142]
High Places	High Places	Indie	2008-09-23 00:00:00	Under The Radar	75.0	If the band's self titled debut marks a letdown from the heights of its early work, it's because the new material has hardly expanded High Paces' musical vocabulary. [Fall 2008, p.75]
The Nature of Things	The Daredevil Christopher Wright	Pop/Rock	2012-06-26 00:00:00	PopMatters	68.0	Overall, The Nature of Things is an incredibly enjoyable listen that's very easy to take in, but it's not quite the classic record that the Daredevil Christopher Wright is clearly capable of making.
I Dreamed We Fell Apart	Memphis	Indie	2004-09-21 00:00:00	AllMusic	67.0	"While most would classify this record under ""folktronica,"" Memphis don't attempt to strip down the clicks and plucks.

The  King Is Dead	The Decemberists	Pop/Rock	2011-01-18 00:00:00	Los Angeles Times	77.0	The King Is Dead clings so closely to formula that it doesn't sound like homage or even truth; it sounds like the studious but unconvincing work of an extremely gifted mimic.
Takk...	Sigur Rós	Indie	2005-09-13 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	84.0	Sigur Rós are still significant, but Takk sounds safe.
Standing in the Breach	Jackson Browne	Pop/Rock	2014-10-07 00:00:00	Brutus54	71.0	Pretty good. Carefully crafted, well played, and pushes a few boundaries, whilst still fitting comfortably  into the JB mould. Dare I say it?Pretty good. Carefully crafted, well played, and pushes a few boundaries, whilst still fitting comfortably  into the JB mould. Dare I say it? A professionally made singer-songwriter album, from an acknowledged master of the genre.  Obviously, I am a fan, so I was going to be pretty well disposed towards JB's work in any case - but to my ear at least, there is more artistry, discipline, melody, soul and warmth here than in just about any new release I have heard this year. I wish there more senior artists retaining such a strong emphasis on quality control in the twilight of their careers. Fun overall - and thought provoking too, in that there is social reflection mixed in with the rock and roll heart.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
MGMT	MGMT	Pop/Rock	2013-09-17 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	62.0	Their cavalcade of goopy dross and hippie-dippy navel-gazing takes a left at transcendence and eventually just lets this bloated trip sputter out altogether.  [20/27 Sep 2013, p.152]
FIDLAR	FIDLAR	Jazz	2013-01-22 00:00:00	PopMatters	72.0	Carper’s lyrics work best when they apply a Duhnam-like sense of self.
Black Hours	Hamilton Leithauser	Pop/Rock	2014-06-03 00:00:00	Record Collector	74.0	While we should never compare a solo artist with their band’s work, when the template they’ve already set over the years is so very strong, and when they don’t at any juncture try to reset it, the feeling of missed opportunity is perhaps potent and hard to escape.
Total 15	Various Artists	Electronic	2015-08-21 00:00:00	XLR8r	74.0	One of the best editions of Total to come along in a while.

Standing on the Rooftop	Madeleine Peyroux	Jazz	2011-06-14 00:00:00	The Independent on Sunday (UK)	69.0	The main signifier is Peyroux's sound, now as downhome as a chicken shack and artfully haunted as a Cassandra Wilson session. Tasteful.
Who Killed Amanda Palmer	Amanda Palmer	Rock	2008-09-16 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	78.0	The album's not for everyone, but if her sound is to your taste, then it will prove a rewarding, delectable, necessary thing: one of this year's most consistently interesting albums.
Classics	She & Him	Pop/Rock	2014-12-02 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	67.0	Losing something in translation is the potential downside of interpreting beloved standards, and while She & Him are lovingly faithful performers, Classics ends up as just pleasant background music.
Transgender Dysphoria Blues	Against Me!	Pop/Rock	2014-01-21 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	82.0	Blues is rawer than the band's last two excellent, arena-fied albums. [31 Jan/7 Feb 2014, p.104]

I was told many positive things about it, though I heard some things about the band having a lack of anything interesting to offer. They were right. This group is basically a remake of the Jonas Brothers, mainly appealing to the female side of the music consuming industry. And that half usually has the most unoriginal, stereotypical music of the entire industry. This band has typical boy band stinkers that has limited appeal and most rely solely off of their teeny-bopping beats. But what they don't understand is that we're SICK of hearing it. Overall the album is a whimsical, pouty-voiced 3/10. Stick to picking up Barbies with limited talent and turning them into pop icons, Hollywood.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;

There Were Wolves	The Accidental	Rock	2008-06-03 00:00:00	Under The Radar	73.0	Some of the droning vocals are hypnotic, but There Were Wolves doesn’t have enough movement to be very satisfying; more like a series of snacks than a full meal. [Summer 2008]

Inside Llewyn Davis [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]	Original Soundtrack	Folk	2013-11-11 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	66.0	"None of the actors have the vocal character of the late Dave Van Ronk, whose biography inspired the film and whose bluesy ""Green, Green Rocky Road"" caps this set, or of another folk singer--the young Bob Dylan--whose rarity ""Farewell"" signals a new era dawning in the film and on this collection."

Odd Blood	Yeasayer	Indie	2010-02-09 00:00:00	Pitchfork	78.0	It's hard to miss the pressure the band was under to deliver here--it's nearly palpable in their overfed production and search for direction, and as a result, Odd Blood is a bit too much of not enough.
Harps And Angels	Randy Newman	Rock	2008-08-05 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	86.0	The characters are memorable, the satire sharp, the music luxurious, and the arrangements maybe the most gorgeous in all pop music.
Out Of Control	Girls Aloud	Rock	2008-11-03 00:00:00	Mojo	63.0	Out Of Control is something kinda meh. [Jan 2008, p.104]
Tomorrow's Modern Boxes	Thom Yorke	Electronic	2014-09-26 00:00:00	The 405	72.0	It's not a radical upheaval and it's nothing especially new--at least as far as Yorke's output is concerned-- but then it doesn't have to be; he's been pioneering an often-unique sound for so long now that I'm just happy to have some other songs to listen to.
Mar Dulce	Bajofondo	Dance	2008-07-15 00:00:00	The New York Times	84.0	Bajofondo brings in guest vocalists as wild cards: singers including Nelly Furtado, Elvis Costello, the Argentine rockers Gustavo Cerati and Juan Subirá, the Mexican rocker Julieta Venegas and the octogenarian Uruguayan tango singer Lágrima Ríos, in her last recording, as well as rapping by Mala Rodriguez (from Spain) and Santullo (from Uruguay). They tip the balance toward imperfect, immediate humanity, and their drama rubs off on the instrumentals too.
Transitions	Elephant & Castle	Electronic	2012-03-27 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	78.0	Mostly, Elephant & Castle captures the sensual possibilities of electronica without settling into well-rubbed grooves.
Right About Now	Talib Kweli	Rap	2005-11-22 00:00:00	Urb	68.0	A quick dozen tunes happily unconcerned with mass appeal. [Jan/Feb 2006, p.95]
Blood Pressures	The Kills	Pop/Rock	2011-04-05 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	76.0	The Kills are back - still covered in dirt, sleaze and reverb, but with a cleaner, softer centre.
Our Ill Wills	Shout Out Louds	Rock	2007-09-11 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	72.0	Our Ill Wills is a good pop album. Now go make your own.
Illuminated By The Light	Weird War	Indie	2005-04-19 00:00:00	Under The Radar	69.0	The production is impeccable. [#9]
Get Back	Pink Mountaintops	Pop/Rock	2014-04-29 00:00:00	Uncut	74.0	An entertaining oddity which manages to recall both Bobby Gillespie and (late) Julian Cope in its reverence for over-the-top rock'n'roll excess. [May 2014, p.78]
Get Behind Me Satan	The White Stripes	Indie	2005-06-07 00:00:00	Mojo	81.0	When the approach works, the results are bracingly exploratory; when it doesn't they're frustratingly half-formed. [Jul 2005, p.94]
The Long Goodbye	The Essex Green	Indie	2003-04-08 00:00:00	Amazon.com	81.0	A diverse and engaging work.
Tough Age	Tough Age	Pop/Rock	2013-11-11 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	67.0	Tough Age’s self-titled debut has its moments, most of them falling in the album’s front third.
"Another Day, Another Time: Celebrating the Music of ""Inside Llewyn Davis"""	Various Artists	Country	2015-01-12 00:00:00	The Telegraph (UK)	67.0	There are inevitable misses as well as hits (House of the Rising Sun is a bit flat) but there is enough variety from musicians such as The Secret Sisters, The Milk Carton Kids, the Punch Brothers and Marcus Mumford (also the associate producer) to keep things rolling along.
Black Soul Choir	Wolves like Us	Pop/Rock	2014-02-24 00:00:00	DIY Magazine	70.0	Chunky, neatly devised and deeply satisfying--this is the sound of staring into a black winter puddle while a nearby bird squirts a veneer of soothing melody onto proceedings.
St. Elsewhere	Gnarls Barkley	Indie	2006-05-09 00:00:00	Playlouder	81.0	It's hard not to feel that the mystique is so damaged by the poor execution of the opening, that the rest of 'St. Elsewhere', however good, struggles to catch up.
Little Wild One	Joan Osborne	Rock	2008-09-09 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	65.0	"Joan Osborne didn't wander too far from the dynamic ""Relish"" after it hit in 1995, but her subsequent recordings haven't captured her as wonderfully all-around until Little Wild One."
The World is Yours	Ian Brown	Rock	2007-09-24 00:00:00	Q Magazine	58.0	The less devout should keep a pinch of salt on stand-by. [Oct 2007, p.100]
Feels	Animal Collective	Indie	2005-10-18 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	84.0	Animal Collective have made the album I hoped they’d make, and even that it’s autumn and summer’s over.
First Impressions Of Earth	The Strokes	Indie	2006-01-03 00:00:00	AllMusic	69.0	The Strokes indulge their every whim, and the results are their weakest album yet.
The Golden Age	American Music Club	Indie	2008-02-19 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	80.0	While the band have shed much of their aggressive musical past, they are able to bring an edge to a wealth of genres that otherwise struggle with balancing a new audience with an older, AOR-accessible set.
Lightning Bolt	Pearl Jam	Pop/Rock	2013-10-15 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	73.0	While the backside wavers, the band has never sounded better or more self-assured, but its ambition suggests they've outgrown simple song collections.
I'm New Here	Gil Scott-Heron	Rap	2010-02-09 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	78.0	This is one of the things that makes I'm New Here such a masterfully stark album. The music is darker, more mechanical than the jazz-inflected backing he used in the '70s, he exhibits few of the tendencies of the genres he helped influence.
Employment	Kaiser Chiefs	Indie	2005-03-15 00:00:00	Elfionnio	78.0	Amazing best album of the 2000s it just takes Punk gives it a modern spins puts in a bit of quirky Kaiser Chiefs magic and makes in greatAmazing best album of the 2000s it just takes Punk gives it a modern spins puts in a bit of quirky Kaiser Chiefs magic and makes in great there would be no audience for bands like Arctic Monkeys and Vaccines if this didn't hit as punk died out.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Amygdala	DJ Koze	Electronic	2013-04-02 00:00:00	Q Magazine	83.0	Amygdala is the sort of wonderfully slowed-down and spun-out electronica that suggests DJ Koze should get himself into the studio more often. [May 2013, p.104]
Here's To Taking It Easy	Phosphorescent	Indie	2010-05-11 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	78.0	It's a rootsy album that is delivered faithfully and respectfully, but one where the strong, clear voice of its author cuts through powerfully.
Rad Times Xpress IV	Black Bananas	Pop/Rock	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM)	70.0	For the most part, Rad Times Xpress IV bubbles over with a love of over the top rock n roll that's impossible to not find endearing.
Hercules And Love Affair	Hercules & Love Affair	Dance	2008-06-24 00:00:00	Almost Cool	86.0	Not only a one of the debuts of the year, but also one of the better releases in general, this self-titled debut from Hercules And Love Affair is worth picking up.
Death to False Metal	Weezer	Pop/Rock	2010-11-02 00:00:00	Billboard.com	56.0	Simply put, Weezer needs to exorcise the metal demons and find a balance that works.
Lovers Rock	Sade	Pop	2000-11-14 00:00:00	Armchair DJ	78.0	"The lushness of 1992's ""Love Deluxe"" has given way to an understatement so pronounced it's almost jarring; this LP sounds like it was recorded in zero gravity."
Lookaftering	Vashti Bunyan	Folk	2005-10-25 00:00:00	Blender	85.0	A gentle, reflective and often gorgeous album. [Nov 2005, p.132]
Amok	Atoms for Peace	Electronic	2013-02-26 00:00:00	Magnet	76.0	True, nothing here ever astonishes, but coming from such a unique voice, the familiar bests most else. [No. 96, p.51]
Wit's End	Cass McCombs	Pop/Rock	2011-04-26 00:00:00	Filter	74.0	The preambular Wit's End (hopefully he hasn't reached his) primes McCombs for the '10s with piano lamentations marking another well-paced (albeit drowsier) long-player.
Romancing	Devin	Pop/Rock	2012-04-10 00:00:00	The Guardian	70.0	There's a mighty gulf between those acts [Devin's musical influences] and scores of garage rockers long since forgotten, and it's one that can only be bridged with the very best songs. And those are what Devin doesn't have.
These Are The Vistas	The Bad Plus	Jazz	2003-02-11 00:00:00	Amazon.com	81.0	Amidst all the fun is a dynamic record that holds your attention.
Gimme Some	Peter Bjorn and John	Pop/Rock	2011-03-29 00:00:00	American Songwriter	74.0	On fifth LP Gimme Some, the Swedish trio has stripped down their sound, and their brand of indie rock has never sounded fresher.
Synesthesia	Hands	Electronic	2013-04-30 00:00:00	Filter	59.0	Hands play the instruments that induce you to dance and hear those sounds that make you want to feel it all.
Key Markets	Sleaford Mods	Pop/Rock	2015-07-24 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	81.0	While it may lack the freshness and shock-of-the-new presented by their previous full-lengths, Key Markets marks the next logical step for the band; the sound of Sleaford Mods’ ultimate rejection.
Rock & Roll Time	Jerry Lee Lewis	Country	2014-10-28 00:00:00	Classic Rock Magazine	72.0	The whole damn album's as sweet as a pecan nut. [Nov 2014, p.93]
Hold Time	M. Ward	Rock	2009-02-17 00:00:00	New York Magazine (Vulture)	79.0	His latest album, Hold Time, is as finely wrought and thoroughly affecting an indie effort as 2009 is likely to see.
Manhattan	Skaters	Pop/Rock	2014-02-25 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	66.0	It is churlish to dismiss a band after one record, however: there is potential here for so much more. This record, however, is the most irritating one you will have heard in a while.
Otherness	Kindness	Pop/Rock	2014-10-14 00:00:00	AllMusic	68.0	"There's only one track with any forward motion, and it's the overly slick and one-dimensional ""I'll Be Back."" Otherwise, Otherness is mostly murky and overcooked ballads, without hooks or much emotional impact."
Funeral	Arcade Fire	Indie	2004-09-14 00:00:00	ShakingThrough.net	90.0	In terms of sheer ambition -- and the realization that if you're going to use strings, you might as well go completely over the top with them -- The Arcade Fire is a promising, unapologetically melodramatic sure bet.
The Clearing	Bowerbirds	Pop/Rock	2012-03-06 00:00:00	The Observer (UK)	77.0	Their songs on this, their third record, are more expansive, bolder and stranger than those that have come before.
Milwaukee At Last!!! [Live]	Rufus Wainwright	Rock	2009-09-22 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	73.0	As a bite-size CV of the last five years of his career, it’s pretty good.
Sigh No More	Mumford & Sons	Indie	2010-02-16 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	68.0	Angst-ridden indiscretions aside, Sigh No More is a fine debut from a band that's patiently picked up the tools of its trade, and chosen the right moment to give them full rein.
TRST	Trust	Electronic	2012-02-28 00:00:00	Resident Advisor	71.0	It is the very overfamiliarity with those same [80's] tropes that makes TRST an ultimately unsurprising, par for the course listen.
Haha Sound	Broadcast	Rock	2003-08-12 00:00:00	Pitchfork	82.0	"An enveloping, mysterious record that marries the idealism of ""the future of tomorrow today"" to the stark reality of the post-millennial present and finds beauty and fascination in the tussle between melody and rhythm."
The Craft	Blackalicious	Rap	2005-09-27 00:00:00	Alternative Press	80.0	Smart, eclectically but authentically funky, and humane to boot. [Oct 2005, p.168]
Picture You Staring	TOPS	Pop/Rock	2014-09-02 00:00:00	AllMusic	80.0	What makes Picture You Staring so deeply enjoyable is the band’s acute sense of when to obscure their sound and when to let it shine through. Walking this tightrope, TOPS never go so far off the deep end of their experimental recording side to completely hide their sad-hearted hooks.
New Moon	The Men	Pop/Rock	2013-03-05 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	76.0	For now, though, New Moon stands as it is: a homey, gut-warming batch of tunes that erratically juggle nostalgia, craft, and ass-kicking abandon.
The Bird And The Bee	The Bird And The Bee	Indie	2007-01-23 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	74.0	Very likable.
Venomous Villain [VV:2]	Viktor Vaughn	Indie	2004-08-03 00:00:00	Village Voice	71.0	VV:2 does have a bit of a for-hire feel.
$O$	Die Antwoord	Electronic	2010-10-12 00:00:00	Billboard.com	69.0	There's a spare but exotic flavor to the 11 tracks on Die Antwoord's new album, $O$, which was first released on the Internet and now comes in a spruced-up major-label version that's noticeably polished but retains the subversive and exotic vibe of the original.
Aufheben	The Brian Jonestown Massacre	Pop/Rock	2012-05-01 00:00:00	Magnet	73.0	Music to take drugs to. [No.87, p.52]
Furious Angels	Rob Dougan	Dance	2003-06-03 00:00:00	Filter	63.0	Too painful to be background music. [#5, p.89]

In Rainbows	Radiohead	Rock	2007-10-10 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	88.0	This is a grownup album, made for grownups.
Maryland Mansions	Cex	Indie	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Almost Cool	75.0	Although there are some moments of greatness on the disc, it feels more like a cathartic vent-session than a well thought-out release.
Tio Bitar	Dungen	Indie	2007-05-15 00:00:00	Spin	79.0	A subtle hallucinatory pastiche. [Jun 2007, p.92]
Woman to Woman	Keyshia Cole	Pop	2012-11-19 00:00:00	Boston Globe	78.0	The songs are uniformly good and produced with restraint to allow the singer room to breathe life into the first-person narratives. Unfortunately, there are two requisite MC cameos, which threaten to sink strong songs.
The Handler	Har Mar Superstar	Indie	2004-09-14 00:00:00	Dot Music	57.0	"Essentially a homage to The Jackson 5/Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder and fellow Minnesotan Prince, ""The Handler"" proves that Har Mar possesses a fine R&B; baritone, is an able rapper and pens exceedingly funky, party-primed tunes with a perfect pop core."
Tear The World Down	We Are The Fallen	Rock	2010-05-11 00:00:00	Sputnikmusic	63.0	We've been left with a blatant emulation of a tired sound by a band that seems so uninspired that they couldn't even be bothered to make enough effort to differentiate their own songs from one another.
Praxis Makes Perfect	Neon Neon	Pop/Rock	2013-04-30 00:00:00	AllMusic	71.0	This is a wonderfully entertaining collection of pop songs that just happen to be well-versed in history and political and economic theories.
Perfect Hair	Busdriver	Rap	2014-09-09 00:00:00	Mojo	74.0	For every two triumphs there's a setback like the overwrought glitchy electro Eat Rich, yet it's hard to deny the imagination that fuels these flights of fancy. [Oct 2014, p.90]
bounty	Iamamiwhoami	Pop/Rock	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	71.0	Like last year’s kin, bounty is a lively collection of electro-pop that does lots with its limited palette.
The Boy Who Knew Too Much	Mika	Rock	2009-09-22 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	70.0	By the time the pop-induced sugar rush wears off you realize that, besides being done before, these songs have definitely been done better. Worse yet, all you've got to show for it is a headache.
Everything Ecstatic	Four Tet	Electronic	2005-05-31 00:00:00	Delusions of Adequacy	77.0	Even at its most intense, Everything Ecstatic combines percussive aggression with warmth and vivid emotion.
Neon Bible	Arcade Fire	Indie	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Sputnikmusic	87.0	It's about as good as Funeral and features some truly wonderful songs; although The Arcade Fire have certainly progressed, Neon Bible features everything that made them special in the first place, to even more epic proportions.
Visions	Grimes	Electronic	2012-02-21 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	80.0	While Visions is unmistakably 2012 sonically in its references to R&B; and hip-hop, it also fits remarkably gracefully into 4AD's impressive back catalogue of dream pop.
In Guards We Trust	Guards	Pop/Rock	2013-02-05 00:00:00	Pitchfork	64.0	At best, the verses, bridges, and instrumental passages feel custodial, doing little to disturb the flow so that the chorus can deliver a proper dynamic boost. Mostly, they just feel like Guards killing time, and Follin's power-pop Madlibs make the 45 minutes of In Guards We Trust feel significantly longer.
I Want You To Destroy Me	Ghost Outfit	Pop/Rock	2013-06-24 00:00:00	The Quietus	66.0	It's quite brilliant and perfectly flawed: the sort of album you don't mind getting run over whilst listening to.
Chelsea Light Moving	Chelsea Light Moving	Pop/Rock	2013-03-05 00:00:00	The Wire	76.0	Moore runs the risk of seeming absorbed in some kind of midlife episode, but he gets away with it by deploying punk spunk as just one of an arsenal of countercultural referents rather than as a means to regain or revisit his youth. [Mar 2013, p.50]
Cannibal	Ke$ha	Pop	2010-11-22 00:00:00	AllMusic	73.0	Sure, Max Martin's hooks, and especially Dr. Luke's neon-colored throb push these tunes into your head--they're in top form, aided by the tight focus of an eight-track EP, Cannibal's brevity trumping the scattershot Animal--but what makes them stick is Kesha, a pop star lacking pop star looks and a pop star voice.
Circuital	My Morning Jacket	Pop/Rock	2011-05-31 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	76.0	Focus on Circuital's sounds, not its content.
Heart	Stars	Indie	2003-08-26 00:00:00	PopMatters	80.0	It is utterly listenable and endlessly sweet.
Backspacer	Pearl Jam	Rock	2009-09-20 00:00:00	Q Magazine	79.0	For the first time in their 19-year career, Pearl Jam actually sound--whisper it--fun. [Oct 2009, p.119]
The Avalanche: Outtakes & Extras From The Illinois Album	Sufjan Stevens	Indie	2006-07-11 00:00:00	MattStep	76.0	Out-takes!!? OUTTAKES!?! Will Mr Stevens please stop hogging all the tunes! I thought this would be patchy at best but it turns out toOut-takes!!? OUTTAKES!?! Will Mr Stevens please stop hogging all the tunes! I thought this would be patchy at best but it turns out to contain many of the best things Sufjan Stevens has done (The Mistress Witch from McClure, Adlai Stevenson, The Henney Buggy Band etc.). I really don&#039;t need three more versions of Chicago though, no matter how good they are.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
April	Sun Kil Moon	Indie	2008-04-01 00:00:00	AllMusic	80.0	Kozelek is simply continuing on his way here, but that said, to stand apart from all the superlatives and just get lost in his creation here, he has made the best record of his career.
Xen	Arca	Electronic	2014-11-04 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	79.0	It’s a gracefully self-contained ecology--a sonic environment rich with empty and warm spaces, within which the listener is urged to breathe more easily and share in a queer feeling of belonging.
Backwoods Barbie	Dolly Parton	Country	2008-02-26 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	70.0	Too much of Backwoods Barbie, her mainstream country comeback, comes off like the overproduced twang of younger country ingénues who try to sound like Dolly Parton.
Strapped	The Soft Pack	Pop/Rock	2012-09-25 00:00:00	No Ripcord	69.0	Strapped's thirty-something minutes of southern California rock doesn't turn the page on anything new, but is still a worthy listen. The album holds true to the band's striped-down signature sound from their last two albums, with a sprinkling of a few stand out tracks.
Disconnect from Desire	School of Seven Bells	Pop/Rock	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	69.0	This album is grounded. Slightly lost and, sadly, all too findable.
Relationship Of Command	At The Drive-In	Indie	2000-09-12 00:00:00	Checkout.com	77.0	At the Drive-In (from El Paso, Texas) picks up where Jane's Addiction leaves off, emitting that thin, distinctive Perry Farrell upper register vocal amid a post-punk apocalyptic guitar/bass/drums detonation. Good for the Addiction, not so good for the Drive-In.
Random Spirit Lover	Sunset Rubdown	Indie	2007-10-09 00:00:00	Village Voice	76.0	Lover's defects stem less from long length than from how densely Krug packs each nervous tic.
Liverpool 8	Ringo Starr	Rock	2008-01-15 00:00:00	Uncut	59.0	"Liverpool 8, which stands happily beside Starr's recent hits compilation, holds its own as a companion piece to McCartney's similarly vital ""Memory Almost Full,"" and makes a nice day off from having to like Radiohead."
Destroyed	Moby	Electronic	2011-05-17 00:00:00	AllMusic	61.0	Latecomers, as well as longtime fans whose favorite Moby material remains the Mimi Goese collaborations on Everything Is Wrong, should have no problem soaking it up.
Let The War Against Music Begin	The Minus 5	Indie	2001-02-27 00:00:00	RichS.	77.0	Not as good as past YFF efforts, but still pretty great.
Good Kid, M.A.A.D City	Kendrick Lamar	Rap	2012-10-22 00:00:00	The Observer (UK)	91.0	Lamar's major-label debut, probably the year's most significant hip-hop release, proves his talent to be as prodigious as his online output.
Freedom's Road	John Mellencamp	Rock	2007-01-23 00:00:00	CindyE	65.0	"John hits the mark. Don&#039;t be fooled by the overplayed ""Our Country"". The rest of the album deserves a serious listen.

Young & Old	Tennis	Pop/Rock	2012-02-14 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	68.0	The problem is, even at their best, Tennis's music seems inconsequential and frankly, neutered.
Until The Earth Begins To Part	Broken Records	Indie	2009-07-07 00:00:00	Q Magazine	64.0	This is a better than promising start. [Jul 2009, p.118]
Old Yellow Moon	Rodney Crowell	Country	2013-02-26 00:00:00	Country Weekly	75.0	Emmylou and Rodney seem at their best with the more up-tempo offerings like Kris Kristofferson’s “Chase the Feeling” and “Bluebird Wine,” which features Rodney’s playful vocals.
Black Holes & Revelations	Muse	Rock	2006-07-11 00:00:00	The Guardian	75.0	It shouldn't work, but Bellamy's mania is so convincingly realised that even the most avowed Muse refusenik may have to finally concede defeat.
Long Wave	Jeff Lynne	Pop/Rock	2012-10-09 00:00:00	No Ripcord	70.0	[The album is] really nothing but fun, and it sounds for the most part like it was put together that way, if we can allow that Lynne's idea of fun is carving out a perfect piece of pop production for each delectable morsel he offers up.
The Facts Of Life	Black Box Recorder	Rock	2001-03-20 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	82.0	The perfect soundtrack for the morning after the tacky sexuality of The Spice Girls and Robbie Williams.
Medulla	Björk	Rock	2004-08-31 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	84.0	A fractured LP, compelling and convincing in its intent, but just plain less satisfying than Vespertine or Post.
Chrome Dreams II	Neil Young	Rock	2007-10-23 00:00:00	Boston Globe	76.0	The veteran rock 'n' roller manages a few neat tricks on this sprawling head-spinner.
Guilt Show	The Get Up Kids	Indie	2004-03-02 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	70.0	The Get Up Kids relies on classic pop arrangements (piano accents, acoustic bridges, moody electronic/orchestral interludes, and climactic choruses) to bring a touch of class to what might otherwise be standard half-hook emo, faintly catchy but fundamentally unmemorable.
Never Trust a Happy Song	Grouplove	Pop/Rock	2011-09-13 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	66.0	"The Californian quintet returns with a full-length release that quite literally recycles the acmes of their EP: ""Colours"" and ""Naked Kids"" return untouched and unchanged, while the remaining 10 tracks suggest the band may be a one-trick pony."
Hardcore Will Never Die, But You Will	Mogwai	Pop/Rock	2011-02-15 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	77.0	If Mogwai are looking for new routes to explore then Hardcore is a strong first venture.
With Love	Zomby	Electronic	2013-07-02 00:00:00	PopMatters	71.0	You just don’t get a sense of the depth and variety of the history Zomby is trying to encapsulate. Also, much of With Love‘s second half is made up of loping, rather dull dub and dubstep.
Believe	Justin Bieber	Pop	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	68.0	Though his new voice has the rambunctiousness that pubescence assumes, it's also marked with the timorousness that's less often celebrated, but equally omnipresent among vocalists trying to figure out the limits of their new range.
Plastic Beach	Gorillaz	Rock	2010-03-09 00:00:00	Absolute Punk (Staff reviews)	77.0	Plastic Beach is a full blown hip-hop/trip-hop album and a prime example of how to stray away from one genre to dominate another. If Albarn has done anything with this project, he has shown his knowledge of flawless production and the ability to create aesthetically pleasing tunes.
A Wretched Virile Lore	Mogwai	Electronic	2012-12-04 00:00:00	Clash Music	62.0	One wonders if the venture should have reached out to the band's full catalogue, but it remains an adventurous extension for those who hold them dear.
Miss Fortune	Allison Moorer	Country	2002-08-06 00:00:00	Mojo	72.0	Relative to her potential, she remains an underachiever, straitjacketed by Nashville craftsmanship in writing and arrangement. [Oct 2002, p.104]
Lesser Evil	Doldrums	Pop/Rock	2013-02-26 00:00:00	CMJ	77.0	While many artists choose to play it safe on their debut album, Doldrums has decided to take us on an untidy journey into his own headspace. Lesser Evil is an unflinching and unashamed document of that trip, like a travelogue of a doomed vacation through Woodhead’s brain.
R Plus Seven	Oneohtrix Point Never	Electronic	2013-09-30 00:00:00	AllMusic	81.0	For the most part, the album showcases Oneohtrix Point Never's restlessness and ambition in flattering ways; if it's equal parts mystifying and beautiful, it's also a puzzle well worth trying to figure out.
Honey From The Tombs	Amy Millan	Indie	2006-08-22 00:00:00	The Guardian	70.0	Pop fans will think it's a country album, country purists will deem it pop and contributions from friends in both Stars and Broken Social Scene adds a conflicting rock slant. What's not in doubt is that Millan makes it work.
The Circle	Bon Jovi	Rock	2009-11-10 00:00:00	Hot Press	52.0	Predictable return to stadium soft-rock from former Poodle-permers.

Learn To Live	Darius Rucker	Rock	2008-09-16 00:00:00	AllMusic	66.0	These songs aren't knockouts, but they're friendly and comfortable, the kind of sturdy roots-pop that seems like it'd be easy to pull off but must not be, as this delicate balance of conversational melody and guy-next-door appeal has proven elusive to Rucker for over a decade now

Trouble Will Find Me	The National	Pop/Rock	2013-05-21 00:00:00	Q Magazine	84.0	For a band who sing so often about matters of the heart and emotional connection, much of Trouble Will Find Me sounds oddly on autopilot. [Jun 2013, p.106]
Hands of Glory	Andrew Bird	Pop/Rock	2012-10-30 00:00:00	American Songwriter	74.0	Bird is too much of a seasoned professional to release anything less than listenable, so although none of this is particularly compelling, it's all well performed in a relatively stripped down, acoustic setting.
Oh, Fortune	Dan Mangan	Pop/Rock	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Uncut	68.0	"Highlights include the waltzing ""About As Helpful As You Can Be Without Being Any Help At All"" and a breathless canter through the Broken Social Scene stylings of ""Post-War Blues."" [Jan 2012, p.93]"

Who We Touch	The Charlatans UK	Pop/Rock	2010-09-14 00:00:00	AllMusic	71.0	It's recognizably the Charlatans--it's hard to disguise Tim Burgess's laconic drawl or the light psychedelic pull of his melodies--but they're unexpectedly abandoning their dad-rock handbook and taking risks, winding with their freshest, best album since they traded the Happy Mondays for the Rolling Stones.

Harlem River Blues	Justin Townes Earle	Country	2010-09-14 00:00:00	AllMusic	83.0	Harlem River Blues is utterly balanced, skillfully crafted, and exquisitely written and produced. Earle proves that he is a force to be reckoned with; in these grooves he embodies the history, mystery, and promise of American roots music.
Axe To Fall	Converge	Rock	2009-10-20 00:00:00	Q Magazine	77.0	Staying true to a 20-year career of uncompromising extremity, it will take commitment to breach this seventh album's walls of noise. [Dec 2009, p. 113]
Solaris	Photek	Electronic	2000-09-19 00:00:00	CDNow	70.0	"Solaris is like no Photek album you've ever heard before: It's an album that celebrates both dance and relaxation, touching on deep house, trip-hop, and ambient, with (gasp) only one drum-and-bass track (the typically spare ""Infinity""). Sentimentality for his musical roots and the desire to create music with a warmer, more human feel drive Photek on these 11 disparate tracks, and the outcome is mixed."
Hollow Meadows	Richard Hawley	Pop/Rock	2015-09-11 00:00:00	Mojo	78.0	Hollow Meadows carries his usual stamp of songwriting quality, but rather than further develop these new sonics and dynamics it feels more like a retrenchment. [Oct 2015, p.88]
Doll Domination	Pussycat Dolls	Dance	2008-09-23 00:00:00	Dot Music	51.0	Given the fact there are 25 tracks and a platoon of songwriters spread over Doll Domination's various bonus discs, it's not surprising that it occasionally succeeds, and there are hit singles to be found here.
The Art Of Losing	American Hi-Fi	Rock	2003-02-25 00:00:00	E! Online	69.0	Once again, it's a batch of arena-ready, metal-friendly, upbeat punk rock that often sounds like Sum 41 doing its best Bay City Rollers impression.
DNA	Little Mix	Pop	2012-11-19 00:00:00	The Observer (UK)	61.0	Such an efficient compendium of current pop influences is a little underwhelmng; nothing here sets out to redefine the girl group sound.
Hummingbird, Go!	Theresa Andersson	Rock	2008-09-02 00:00:00	Pitchfork	75.0	These elements [traces of her jazz and blues-rock past] add splashes of unexpected color to these songs, bringing the extroversion of those styles to the too often introverted genre of indie pop and making Hummingbird, Go! sound to big for any kitchen to contain.
American III: Solitary Man	Johnny Cash	Rock	2000-10-17 00:00:00	Ricko	80.0	"Outside of Johnny Cash, I'm not really into Country Music , but I think he transcends the genre.

His ""American"" project is a good test of the concept ""Is it the song or the singer?"". The argument being if a song is a classic, it's very hard to mess it up. Cash can never be accused of messing these up. In fact it could be argued he brings the quality some of these songs into sharp focus with stripped down versions, with all studio trickery and effects stripped away, often all your left with are the lyrics and the chords. Although I prefer American IV,  American III is quite good overall. There are a few questionable inclusions here but the high points on this record are in my view, up with the high points of his career. His version of U2's ""One"" and Nick Caves ""The Mercy Seat"" are sublime.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"

Harbors	All Tiny Creatures	Pop/Rock	2011-03-29 00:00:00	Pitchfork	69.0	That sense of focus on making emotionally redolent material, and keeping the overall thrust of the project in view despite having many hands on the tiller, are ultimately what makes Harbors solidify into a satisfyingly cohesive whole.
Paracosm	Washed Out	Pop/Rock	2013-08-13 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	73.0	Mostly, Paracosm is Chromatics if their nocturnal danger was replaced by nocturnal emissions, or Beach House if they got so stoned they forgot to change chords for minutes at a time.
Tapes	The Rapture	Indie	2008-11-25 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	73.0	Though the band are by no means no superstar DJs, the enthusiasm for the music they love is all too apparent. If anything, Tapes will send you digging for the full versions of some fine, forgotten tunes--and that’s no bad thing.
Fantasies	Metric	Indie	2009-04-14 00:00:00	Pitchfork	77.0	The story here though is the album's simmering, intimate moments--and despite the fanbase-building qualities of their new-wave past, the more the group embraces an inky, ambient future, the better it  could get.
Bleed Like Me	Garbage	Rock	2005-04-12 00:00:00	Alternative Press	56.0	There are no real surprises on Bleed, but as a return to the steady Garbage ferocity of old, it's first rate. [May 2005, p.134]
God Forgives, I Don't	Rick Ross	Rap	2012-07-31 00:00:00	The Wire	70.0	Lyrically it is all shamelessly hollow, but Ross's album is seductively swish, its production sophisticated and strings and saxophone abound. [Oct 2012, p.75]
They Threw Us in a Trench and Stuck a Monument On Top	Liars	Indie	2002-08-20 00:00:00	Launch.com	77.0	Liars got the punk wave thing down, but what makes them more interesting than their peers is their willingness to explore beyond the edges of the new-wave box.
Time Being	Ron Sexsmith	Rock	2006-05-15 00:00:00	Alternative Press	79.0	The focus on time and its ravages may seem to place this in 35-and-over territory, but Sexsmith's songs are timeless. [Mar 2007, p.136]
Friendly Bacteria	Mr. Scruff	Electronic	2014-05-20 00:00:00	Mojo	67.0	For much of the album's remainder, Carthy sticks with the melting pot approach that he and Greater Mancunian peers like Rae & Christian helped codify over a decade ago. [Jun 2014, p.93]

Game Theory	The Roots	Rap	2006-08-29 00:00:00	The A.V.

Paramore	Paramore	Electronic	2013-04-09 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	81.0	If Paramore has a flaw, it’s that there’s so much going on and so many stylistic flourishes, the record never quite coalesces.
Frank Black Francis	Frank Black	Indie	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Junkmedia	69.0	[Disc 1 is] a revealing, if not quite essential, portrait of the artist.... [Disc 2 is] an inventive, rewarding look at the Pixies esteemed catalogue.
Tommy	Dosh	Electronic	2010-04-13 00:00:00	AllMusic	76.0	The pieces here -- it's hard to call them songs or tracks -- are almost ambient, but there's too much noise and too many shifting sounds to keep you from spacing out for too long.

A.) This album, and Twin Sister themselves, are not dream pop. B.) ""In Heaven"" does sound like just another less-than-creative band going through the motions. But C.) This album is damn enjoyable. The production quality utilizes great space separation and just enough crisp compression. Andrea Estella's voice is just right throughout, with a smoky texture and off-and-on stark & discreet melodies. A refreshing lack of reverb easily puts this band ahead of their contemporaries. All of the band members are locked in, and when the hooks aren't catchy they still maintain a decent groove.I wouldn't guarantee that anyone could love this album, as I'm still not sure I do, but it's definitely worth 2 listens.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"

Mister Pop	The Clean	Indie	2009-09-08 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	67.0	Mister Pop doesn’t quite measure up even to the first few Clean records from their third return (Modern Rock is an overlooked gem); it feels a bit haphazard at times, the instrumentals don’t need to be there, and Robert Scott’s song isn’t as potent as usual.

Until in Excess, Imperceptible UFO	The Besnard Lakes	Alternative/Indie Rock	2013-04-02 00:00:00	The Quietus	76.0	Until In Excess, Imperceptible UFO has lofty ambitions of space on one hand, and a great deal of heart and soul to keep it simultaneously grounded on the other.

Sigh No More	Mumford & Sons	Indie	2010-02-16 00:00:00	RoverJones	68.0	"I'm sorry but I've gotta go along with Pitchfork on this one. It has one song that sticks, I guess for lyrical/personal/whatever reasons. (""II'm sorry but I've gotta go along with Pitchfork on this one. It has one song that sticks, I guess for lyrical/personal/whatever reasons. (""I Gave You All."" I freakin' love that song.) But the aesthetic from one song to the next is *identical.*I'm not saying that they don't have a certain knack for building up the tempo to a cacophony and letting Marcus Mumford's voice ride the instruments like a wave. They're not half bad at it. But they aren't exactly the best there's ever been, yet they do it on EVERY SONG. On a contemporary level, Arcade Fire and The Decemberists easily have them beat at that. What makes those bands as good as they are (or great, in Arcade Fire's case) is that they don't copy this formula on every song. They show off their wealth of other talents.When you can do something pretty-well-but-not-great, as M&S; do with their folk anthemic climaxes, you should think about switching it up and writing a new song once in a while. And P4k, I'm sad to say, is spot on. When every song has the exact same formula, the album as a whole starts to sound disingenuous and I become totally disconnected with it. Imagine if Fleet Foxes had used the wordless chorus-double verse-A Capella 3-4-part harmonies on EVERY song on Sun Giant as they did with Mykonos. It would've been horrible, and a real slight to the genre of folk rock.I'm not going to say that this isn't a good band. (Yet.) If they could chill on the soft-loud formula like some sort of folk rock Nirvana, maybe use it on one or two songs in an album, and use the rest of the space for--I dunno--something else, I can hear what they're made of.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"
Until the Quiet Comes	Flying Lotus	Pop/Rock	2012-10-02 00:00:00	XLR8r	83.0	It would be a stretch to call Until the Quiet Comes' disjointed tracklist and middling retreads the low point of Ellison's discography, but suffice it to say that the LA cornerstone has produced far more challenging and consistent records than this.

Before The Dawn Heals Us	M83	Electronic	2005-01-25 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	76.0	Before The Dawn Heals Us is a very twilight album, a very urban record. It never quite achieves the variegated subtlety of Dead Cities..., but it doesn’t reach for the same frosty rural pastures as that record either.
In Black and Gold	Hey Colossus	Pop/Rock	2015-02-17 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	82.0	A more diverse and calculated album than a usual Hey Colossus offering, and all the better for it.
VYP: Voice of the Young People	Lil' Mama	Rap	2008-04-29 00:00:00	The Guardian	71.0	Such is the catchiness of this generally lovable record that it's easy to miss the bleak thrust of her lyrics.
Outer South	Conor Oberst And The Mystic Valley Band	Indie	2009-05-05 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	67.0	"As is often the case when a rarefied musician enjoys themself too much though, this is a wildly self-indulgent

Every Kind Of Light	The Posies	Indie	2005-06-28 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	66.0	As inconsistent as it is, Every Kind of Light, the first full-band Posies record of the century, curbs the pair’s excesses enough to reward repeat plays.
Relax	Das Racist	Rap	2011-09-13 00:00:00	Delusions of Adequacy	78.0	Das Racist takes the strengths off their mixtapes and simply take them on a new adventure with Relax.
The Golden Record	Little Scream	Pop/Rock	2011-04-12 00:00:00	AllMusic	77.0	Everything sounds gorgeous, from Little Scream's hazy warble to the two minutes of rainfall, audible rush-hour traffic, and wind chimes that end the album. This is an absolute beast of a debut.
Led Zeppelin I [Remastered]	Led Zeppelin	Rock	2014-06-03 00:00:00	Pitchfork	97.0	Led Zeppelin is one of music's most assured and fully realized debuts; individually, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, and John Bonham were great players, but the whole of their sound somehow exceeded the sum of its parts. But even above the instrumental virtuosity, Led Zeppelin is a triumph of production, each part clear and forceful but adding up to something even more powerful.
In Waves	Trivium	Pop/Rock	2011-08-09 00:00:00	Alternative Press	66.0	In Waves hits some high notes with solo-heavy scorchers, but bury them seven tracks deep is as dumbfounding as their guitar work is breathtaking. [Sep 2011, p.120]
Dirty Jeans and Mudslide Hymns	John Hiatt	Country	2011-08-02 00:00:00	Boston Globe	73.0	Singer-songwriter John Hiatt's 20th album shows him still cranking out quality roots music for grown-ups.
Ultramarine	Young Galaxy	Pop/Rock	2013-04-23 00:00:00	PopMatters	76.0	McCandless has a great voice, and when Young Galaxy gives her strong material their songs really work. But she can’t do it on her own, and the middle chunk of Ultramarine proves that.

But on their next attempt, Freelance Whales should tone down the maudlin, veer away from Sufjan territory, subtract a few bells and whistles and grow up with the college crowd.

Amok	Atoms for Peace	Electronic	2013-02-26 00:00:00	PopMatters	76.0	Though the roster of Atoms for Peace suggests a perfect blend of talents, the resultant amok is too much, too rapid, and too overwrought to reach the group’s full potential.
Drums Between the Bells	Brian Eno	Electronic	2011-07-05 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	68.0	At times Drums Between The Bells is too busy, too packed with musical style and incident, but its patchwork nature reveals itself over subsequent listens to be a largely rewarding one.

Ascension	Jesu	Pop/Rock	2011-05-10 00:00:00	PopMatters	75.0	Not quite as candy-coated as Conqueror or as harrowing as Jesu, it's mostly notable for both Broadrick's high level of quality control (unless you just outright dislike his kind of music, his songs are always at least pleasingly consistent in tone and impact) and his increasing, perhaps unwitting, move away from song form.
Two Dancers	Wild Beasts	Rock	2009-09-08 00:00:00	Dot Music	83.0	Much scruffier and far less inhibited than Coldplay, and way more compelling than Editors, Two Dancers is widescreen stuff nonetheless and an album that will carry them across more thresholds than their first.

We Are Him	Angels Of Light	Indie	2007-08-28 00:00:00	PopMatters	77.0	It’s a choppy album, it never settles into any sort of rhythm, and the moments that stick, that haunt you for days after you’ve heard them, are few.

Long in the Tooth	Billy Joe Shaver	Country	2014-08-05 00:00:00	AllMusic	77.0	Long in the Tooth features ten new Shaver songs, and if his voice by now (the album was released in his 75th year) has worn to a deep, rough rasp, the songs are as strong and as vital and world-weary wise as ever.
Live It Up	Lee DeWyze	Pop/Rock	2010-11-16 00:00:00	AllMusic	45.0	When things are light and simple on Live It Up, DeWyze seems like himself: a threadbare talent who floated in on the vapors of Idol's empty tank.
Skying	The Horrors	Pop/Rock	2011-08-09 00:00:00	Q Magazine	83.0	There are  meandering moments on Skying--closer Oceans Burning's day-trip into prog palls after a while--but it continues The Horrors' fast-forward evolution from their dark larval form into lepidopterist's delight. [Aug 2011, p.110]

Same As You	Polar Bear	Jazz	2015-04-14 00:00:00	The Line of Best Fit	79.0	Same As You isn’t going to be the most exciting release from Polar Bear you’ll hear, but it is a solid and entirely welcomd release from a band who rarely put a foot wrong.
It's Not Me, It's You	Lily Allen	Rock	2009-02-10 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	71.0	Greg Kurstin helped deliver everything both artist and mercenary label boss could wish for. Songs that are ultra-modern and instantly accessible, fun but never cheesy, experimental but rarely try-hard.

Paul's Tomb: A Triumph	Frog Eyes	Indie	2010-04-27 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	80.0	This release feels freer, though--not easier, necessarily, but delivered with a clarity of purpose not quite as muddled, consumption-wise, by sheer weirdness as was their previous LP, Tears Of The Valedictorian, for instance.

Standards	Lloyd Cole	Pop/Rock	2014-10-14 00:00:00	American Songwriter	83.0	Cole has written a batch of terrific songs and turns in some of his most passionate and committed performances. The tunes are literate, often wickedly funny but remain laced with Cole’s smooth hang-dog vocals.
We Be Xuxa	Mika Miko	Indie	2009-05-12 00:00:00	Los Angeles Times	67.0	Many moments of We Be Xuxa come close to fulfilling the band's Slits-meets-Wipers mania, but much of the record feels so giddily tossed off that one almost wishes for a little sheen.

Recover [EP]	Chvrches	Electronic	2013-03-26 00:00:00	CMJ	75.0	The trio’s past experiences may explain how it manages to exercise a seasoned talent for both variety and control.... The two “Recover” remixes, by Austria’s Cid Rim and U.K.-based Curxes, are filler. They’re pleasant on their own, but neither can hold up to the original.
True Magic [First Version]	Mos Def	Rap	2006-12-29 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	45.0	Mos Def’s third album is worth a careful listen: it’s not a happy record, and there are few, if any, genius rhymes. But it speaks volumes about the frustration and resignation of the underprivileged.

Shriek	Wye Oak	Electronic	2014-04-29 00:00:00	The 405	76.0	This album is more of a reset than a reinvention, ditching the guitar was meant to make or break them, but it's kind of done neither.

He even invigorates '90s trip-hop's head-nod (""Before,"" the title track), making for an even better coast soundtrack."
Illuminate	Alex Banks	Electronic	2014-06-10 00:00:00	Mixmag	81.0	It’s absolutely breathtaking in its audacity and intergalactic ambition, and even breathtakingly beautiful in places. But... it’s bloody tiring too.

Modern Rituals	Chief	Pop/Rock	2010-08-17 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	56.0	Musically, the song structures are as bog-standard as Britpop, the lyrics constantly teeter on the edge of nonsense, while the lack of any real change in style save for rotating the guy on vocals means the tracks continue to merge into one another even after a few listens.

Forever	Painted Palms	Pop/Rock	2014-01-14 00:00:00	CMJ	65.0	Painted Palms’ strength is in their balmy, unhurried melodies. But even such melodic virtues are no match for the sexless nothingness that permeates this record.
Black Cascade	Wolves in the Throne Room	Rock	2009-03-31 00:00:00	Pitchfork	75.0	All of Black Cascade pounds away with a similar notion for four tracks and 50 minutes, offering four black metal tides that occasionally shift into some texturally bankrupt, wintry drone.
It's Frightening	White Rabbits	Indie	2009-05-19 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	74.0	It’s Frightening builds upon White Rabbits’ established aesthetic and at the same time sharpens the band’s shambling attack.

Field Songs	William Elliott Whitmore	Pop/Rock	2011-07-12 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	83.0	"Though that rustic snapshot edges perilously close to self-parody for Whitmore, the track [""We'll Carry On""]--and Field Songs as a whole--also sharply defines his elemental strengths."
Skelethon	Aesop Rock	Rap	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	79.0	For Skelethon is the kind of record an artist only makes once in their career; the culmination of long-gestation, departing loved ones and having to innovate out of your comfort zone.

TP.3 Reloaded	R. Kelly	Pop	2005-07-05 00:00:00	Vibe	60.0	While the content is strictly sex obsessed, the range of musical styles here is as varied and satisfying as the many positions and places the album will take you. [Sep 2005, p.229]

Long Enough to Leave	Mantles	Pop/Rock	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	75.0	Long Enough To Leave might not blaze much of a unique trail, wearing its love of the past proudly on its sleeve. That said, it still delivers its share of gems culled from other well-traveled musical paths.
Church Gone Wild / Chirpin Hard	Hella	Indie	2005-03-22 00:00:00	BrandonS.	64.0	Holy shucks! Not their greatest. Hey just got Zach hill and the holy smokes cd/book thing, buy that! Buy this too AAAA!!

Sing to the Moon	Laura Mvula	Pop/Rock	2013-05-14 00:00:00	Spin	73.0	The album's first half is suffused with a longing that flits between hopeful and resigned, unsure which is the worse fate. At other times, she sounds a little exasperated--mournful even--but throughout, her elegant arrangements remain taut and full of energy.
Hotel Morgen	To Rococo Rot	Electronic	2004-05-18 00:00:00	Junkmedia	72.0	Hotel Morgen serves as a blend of some of the more appealing aspects of both the electronic avant-garde and its more mainstream dance music wing.
Hearts Of Oak	Ted Leo & The Pharmacists	Indie	2003-02-11 00:00:00	Spin	84.0	The songs are flat-out rollicking, like what Fugazi might come up with if their tour-van radio got stuck on the classic-rock station. [Feb 2003, p.98]

Inni [Live]	Sigur Rós	Pop/Rock	2011-11-15 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	78.0	Inni is beautiful and alluring, yes, but ultimately a recycled bit of nostalgia likely to please very few.
Refractory Obdurate	Wovenhand	Folk	2014-04-29 00:00:00	Pitchfork	86.0	The album finally makes good on the post-punk and metal influences that have forever lingered at the edges of Wovenhand’s output.
The Sea of Memories	Pallers	Pop/Rock	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Pitchfork	75.0	Admittedly, the album's moves are exceedingly well-worn, yet like fellow 21st century synth-poppers Junior Boys, Pallers' precise craftsmanship means they're also able to elicit many of the same deeply affecting moods and sensations as their forbears.

Pretty In Black	The Raveonettes	Indie	2005-05-03 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	74.0	The larger scope of the album bodes well for The Raveonettes... [but] it’s a shame that there are several clunkers mixed with such strong material.

A Dream Outside	Gengahr	Pop/Rock	2015-06-16 00:00:00	DIY Magazine	79.0	It’s still a work that’s defined by its own dynamism. Anyone following these guys from the start won’t have doubted their capabilities, but that doesn’t stop A Dream Outside from dwarfing expectations.

Rose Windows	Rose Windows	Pop/Rock	2015-05-04 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	68.0	The album only features nine tracks, but somehow still contrives to feel over-long and lack cohesion.
Shadows	Teenage Fanclub	Rock	2010-06-08 00:00:00	PopMatters	81.0	Shadows completes a remarkable transformation. While no one was looking, Teenage Fanclub went from being rude, laddish pop malcontents with a wicked ironic streak, to subtle, reflective, utterly sincere singer-songwriters.

National Anthem Of Nowhere	Apostle Of Hustle	Indie	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Pitchfork	68.0	Where Folkloric Feel opted for cobwebby murk, National Anthem of Nowhere dovetails in bright, tidy corners. It's at once straight-laced and funky in the way that only indie rock can be.
The Fall	Norah Jones	Rock	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Dot Music	73.0	If the hardcore fanbase feel a blanch coming on, this isn't all wilful eclecticism gone mad. King's work is The Fall's unifying factor that keeps it cohesive.
Spiritual Mental Physical	Death	Pop/Rock	2011-01-25 00:00:00	AllMusic	65.0	Little was done to clean them up: they're rough, woolly, and loose, but they rock.
Speakerboxxx/The Love Below	Outkast	Rap	2003-09-23 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	91.0	If you can name me just one rapper that made a more complete record in 2003 than either of these two Southern boys' efforts, I&#146;ll call you a liar.
Brighter Than Creation's Dark	Drive-By Truckers	Indie	2008-01-22 00:00:00	Delusions of Adequacy	83.0	With their trademark of talented musicianship, beautiful story-telling and unique brand of rock and roll, Drive-By Truckers are unmatched in every sense of the word. This is a remarkable album and one that is downright near perfect.
In Black and Gold	Hey Colossus	Pop/Rock	2015-02-17 00:00:00	The Line of Best Fit	82.0	Despite the odd misstep, it deserves to be lauded as the band’s finest hour as well as a genuinely bold adventure into the cosmos of heavy rock.

Kingdom Of Rust	Doves	Indie	2009-04-07 00:00:00	Pitchfork	77.0	Doves' fourth album is another sterling example of why the Doves should be household names and why they probably won't ever be: their unwavering flair for producing mountainous, Wembley-worthy pop anthems that are nonetheless invested with a palpable degree of grace and humility.
Player Player	Kpt.Michi.Gan	Electronic	2003-06-10 00:00:00	Almost Cool	79.0	It's a bit harsh of me to say that there's nothing interesting going on in Player, Player because that's certainly not the case. Instead, the problem seems to be with contructing the songs themselves.
Sweet Warrior	Richard Thompson	Rock	2007-05-29 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	84.0	"The tightness of Thompson's compositions grounds the explosive, whimsical meandering of his improvs; Sweet Warrior, and ""Guns Are The Tongues"" in particular, captures that glory as well as anything else from this century."
Pale Fire	El Perro del Mar	Pop/Rock	2012-12-04 00:00:00	CMJ	66.0	On her fifth album, she discovers a new direction--and sounds all the better for it.

Landing Gear	Devin The Dude	Rap	2008-10-07 00:00:00	RapReviews.com	68.0	"It's fair to say that if there's one criticism of Devin that can truly stick it's that he takes the ""Dude"" aspect of his personality very seriously, and in few songs will you see him regard women as more than just objects of his sexual conquest. Nonetheless songs like 'Me, You' show he can still charm a girl or two."
Little Wild One	Joan Osborne	Rock	2008-09-09 00:00:00	Uncut	65.0	It's all very well intended, but seldom rises above the superficial. [Dec 2008, p.108]

Meyrin Fields	Broken Bells	Pop/Rock	2011-03-29 00:00:00	AllMusic	65.0	Meyrin Fields may be under 12 minutes long, but it's still a musical goodie bag that sounds like it was as much fun to make as it is to hear.
Mojo	Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers	Rock	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Uncut	72.0	Unfortunately, and rather ironically, Mojo is ultimately undone by the very virtuosity of its creators: the band stumbles repeatedly into that musican's trap of making music that sounds intended principally to impress other musicans. [July 2010, p.102]
Simple Math	Manchester Orchestra	Pop/Rock	2011-05-10 00:00:00	Sputnikmusic	73.0	Remember what I said about this band being capable of a classic? Well 'Simple Math' is their first. Just a shame about Simple Math.
Twenty One	Mystery Jets	Indie	2008-03-24 00:00:00	The Guardian	75.0	This is a vividly youthful album, packed with acid-sharp lyrics and neon-bold choruses, playful vocal harmonies and strikingly confident pop sounds.
Living Proof	Buddy Guy	Rap	2010-10-25 00:00:00	The New York Times	74.0	What's wrong with the record is plain. The lyrics' first-person mythmaking gets trite. The guest appearances sound fainthearted, tailored to the ears of Grammy voters. But the heart of the record is deeply, honorably misbehaved.
Loose In The Air	The Double	Indie	2005-09-13 00:00:00	Alternative Press	78.0	If you're a fan of the British installment of the Nuggets collection, this album was made for you. [Oct 2005, p.166]
All Of A Sudden I Miss Everyone	Explosions in the Sky	Indie	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Spin	80.0	Let's just put it this way: Throw All of a Sudden on while playing GameCube, and you'll have the most dramatic LEGO Star Wars experience imaginable. [Mar 2007, p.94]
A List of the Burning Mountains	Oneida	Pop/Rock	2012-11-13 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	61.0	A Oneida stop-gap rehearsal session is more satisfying than most bands' carefully crafted showcase albums, but this LP doesn't reach the same dizzy heights as their previous run of mind-blowing releases.
Innocents	Moby	Electronic	2013-09-30 00:00:00	Blurt Magazine	60.0	Majestically sad (“Almost Home,” “Saints”), soulfully sad (“A Case For Shame”), atmospherically sad (“Going Wrong”), trip hop sad (“The Last Day,” “Tell Me”), Northern soul sad (“Don’t Love Me”) are all interesting but often too subtle variations that almost make you want to force feed him Zoloft at times.
Mars	Sinkane	Pop/Rock	2012-11-13 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	79.0	A diasporic pop beacon for those of us from neither here nor there.
New Amerykah Part Two: Return of the Ankh	Erykah Badu	R&B;	2010-03-30 00:00:00	AllMusic	83.0	Return of the Ankh is a relief in that Badu does not attempt to trump herself with a set that is even more intense and powerful than its predecessor.
Blitzkrieg Pop	T. Raumschmiere	Electronic	2005-08-23 00:00:00	Junkmedia	62.0	The punk-informed material on Blitzkrieg Pop sounds like the missing link between Ministry's earlier, sensitive electro material and its later and more well-known incarnation as the nihilistic buzz-sawing and bile-spewing industrial unit.
Songs In Red And Gray	Suzanne Vega	Rock	2001-09-25 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	81.0	Revealing a songwriter unwilling to compromise even when it hurts, Songs makes her return all the more welcome.
Anxiety	Ladyhawke	Pop/Rock	2012-05-29 00:00:00	Sputnikmusic	64.0	While it fails to better its predecessor, Anxiety is a mature, personal and vulnerable release that is both a brave and natural evolution for an undoubtedly talented artist.

The Evolution	Ciara	Pop	2006-12-05 00:00:00	Billboard	65.0	"Songs such as the Rodney Jerkins-produced ""Make It Last Forever"" and ""Get Up""... are surefire club hits, although such ballads as ""It's Over"" tend to fall flat. [9 Dec 2006]"
Strip Me	Natasha Bedingfield	Pop/Rock	2010-12-07 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	60.0	Strip Me is a deceptively saucy name for the lighter-waver that launches the U.K. diva's third disc – like her smash Unwritten, it's a bouncy female-empowerment anthem.
The Process Of Belief	Bad Religion	Rock	2002-01-22 00:00:00	krid23	74.0	What a comeback album with Brett Gurewitz back in the lineup. Lyrically this is a very strong album of Bad Religion which is saying quite aWhat a comeback album with Brett Gurewitz back in the lineup. Lyrically this is a very strong album of Bad Religion which is saying quite a bit since most things related to this band is truly classical when it comes to song writing abilities of Greg Graffin and Mr. Brett. Stand out tracks on this album are: Epiphany,Evangeline, Sorrow and Bored & Extremely Dangerous. I would go as far as to say, that this album is quite comparable to Bad Religion's classic 1988 released Suffer album.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;

Beautiful Rewind	Four Tet	Electronic	2013-10-15 00:00:00	Pitchfork	79.0	At just over 40 minutes, Beautiful Rewind is an effortless listen, but when it wanders it feels like a bauble, one from an artist from whom we are accustomed to receiving richer gifts.
Here We Go Magic	Here We Go Magic	Indie	2009-02-24 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	72.0	The advance buzz about Luke Temple’s first record as Here We Go Magic suggested the Brooklyn-based songwriter could be about to do a Grizzly Bear, but his latest project is a far more introspective beast.
Riceboy Sleeps	Jonsi & Alex	Rock	2009-07-21 00:00:00	Ricko	73.0	A very interesting ambience collaboration between the Sigure Ros man and his boyfriend Alex Somers. Unlike Jonsi's solo record, this bearsA very interesting ambience collaboration between the Sigure Ros man and his boyfriend Alex Somers. Unlike Jonsi's solo record, this bears little resemblance to the Sigure Ros sound. It's the kind of music you can immerse yourself in if you were meditating or relaxing somewhere. It really takes you away. It doesn't really have any traditional songs but is made up of a series of sprawling tracks. I'd recommend for pre sleep listening or listening to while in the bath - that's not saying it's boring, its saying its a chillax album.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;

Beast Moans	Swan Lake	Indie	2006-11-21 00:00:00	Pitchfork	66.0	Like the best work of its participants, Beast Moans is no pornographer's rubdown; it delivers on its tease.
Darwin Deez	Darwin Deez	Pop/Rock	2011-05-24 00:00:00	AllMusic	67.0	Darwin Deez is a guy who has clearly created a persona to deliver his material, but that doesn't disguise the fact he has a lot of talent and has a made an album that proves he's a 21st century indie pop prodigy with a promising future.
I Am Not a Human Being	Lil Wayne	Rap	2010-10-12 00:00:00	American Songwriter	67.0	When Wayne is on, he's one of the best in the game, but on Human Being he's just killing time with sub-par versions of his far more popular songs – this is a completely superfluous release that lacks the relevance and immediacy of his mixtape works and the quality-control of his albums.

Mr. M	Lambchop	Pop/Rock	2012-02-21 00:00:00	BBC Music	80.0	If there's a problem here it's how personal this album is, how bleak and heartbroken its protagonist appears. This is not music romanticising heartbreak, but the very sound of heartbreak itself.
Midnight Memories	One Direction	Pop	2013-11-25 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	59.0	If maturing means 14 (regular edition) tracks of footy-stadium-worthy anthemic choruses ad nauseam, I don’t want 1-D to grow up.

Helplessness Blues	Fleet Foxes	Pop/Rock	2011-05-03 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	85.0	Wide-eyed self-searching is this record's predominant mode, which Fleet Foxes do both lyrically and sonically, reveling in the process of discovery.
Everybody Wah	Bosco Delrey	Pop/Rock	2011-06-14 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	65.0	Provides more than enough reasons to keep Bosco Delrey's warm tunes on your playlist beyond the cold winter.
Blood Money	Tom Waits	Rock	2002-05-07 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	84.0	"At times it almost seems like a conscious attempt to strip away the romantic veneer with which Alice covered its ""closed-down cabaret,"" finding only insanity and sadness amongst the dust and bones."
Tinsel And Lights	Tracey Thorn	Pop/Rock	2012-10-30 00:00:00	Clash Music	76.0	There's nothing here to write home about but it should make a nice stocking filler for Mum.
Belle and Sebastian Write About Love	Belle & Sebastian	Pop/Rock	2010-10-12 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	75.0	Celebrity guest star wobbles aside, Write About Love is a well crafted, very listenable album, one that sees Belle and Sebastian ditch the qualities of their music that were starting to cloy without totally jettisoning the old charm.
Our Endless Numbered Days	Iron & Wine	Indie	2004-03-23 00:00:00	AndrewP	84.0	Some of the best lyrics ever recorded, and the music complements them so well. Everything about this record is truly astouding.

Natural	Mekons	Rock	2007-08-21 00:00:00	AllMusic	77.0	Natural is a quiet but disconcerting snapshot of a world of chaos, which is to say it depicts a world not so different than the one that saw the birth of the Mekons in 1977, and confirms their message has remained constant even when their musical approach has not.
Listen, Whitey! The Sounds of Black Power 1967-1974	Various Artists	R&B;	2012-02-28 00:00:00	PopMatters	82.0	Listen, Whitey is as much about how voices resonate--about the power of the right words, about how the most powerful weapon in a revolution may be a microphone or recording equipment--as it is about what they say.

Featherbrain	Hanne Hukkelberg	Pop/Rock	2012-03-06 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	78.0	Featherbrain is another solid album from the unassuming Norwegian, even if it lacks the direction and cohesiveness of her previous offerings.
Culture of Volume	East India Youth	Pop/Rock	2015-04-07 00:00:00	The Quietus	78.0	This is an album that sounds massive, pompous, threatening, druggy, psychically hollow, a mirror turned against the daily noise... and is all the better for it.
Take Me To The Sea	Jaguar Love	Indie	2008-08-19 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	69.0	They’re still working out the kinks, though, so a few tracks fail to match their ambition.
Goon	Tobias Jesso Jr.	Pop/Rock	2015-03-17 00:00:00	Clash Music	81.0	Goon is not perfect, but it's the imperfections and the straight honesty that bleeds through it that make it so appealing.
Take Care	Drake	Pop	2011-11-15 00:00:00	The Guardian	78.0	Former child actor Aubrey Graham's much-vaunted sensitivity and introspection is more hollow than ever on his second album.
Real Emotional Trash	Stephen Malkmus	Rock	2008-03-04 00:00:00	Billboard	76.0	Janet Weiss adds welcome flavor on drums and vocals, but overall, how much you enjoy rummaging through this Trash will probably depend on the amount of patience you have for the Malkmus' indulgences.

Held in Splendor	Quilt	Pop/Rock	2014-01-28 00:00:00	Spin	74.0	Rough in all the right places but pleasurably smooth in others, Held in Splendor is less like the kitschy t-shirt quilt you made to remember your high school clubs and teams, and more like the perfect old blankets your grandmother used to sew: oversized, musty, and familiar even when you haven't worn them in years.
Out Among the Stars	Johnny Cash	Country	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Exclaim	69.0	Out Among the Stars is, at least contextually, a reminder that sometimes things got in Johnny Cash's way, but there are very few forces on Earth that could stifle his voice and conviction when he set his mind to getting a song across.

Lonesome Dreams	Lord Huron	Pop/Rock	2012-10-09 00:00:00	BBC Music	68.0	Ultimately, God is less in the details, here, and Lonesome Dreams' success lies largely in the irrefutably vaulting sweep of the music and the ineffable air of melancholy-dented redemption which it so effectively conjures.
Neon Bible	Arcade Fire	Indie	2007-03-06 00:00:00	Lost At Sea	87.0	Neon Bible may be a bold departure from the beloved Funeral, but the divergence is as inspired as the music itself.

With the ""Detroit"" mixtape and ""Hall of Fame"" I hold them as his best and also as a new bright start for the kid. Big Sean has improved, it's heard here. Lyrically got the skill up and as an artist he's gotten better. The beat selection's are crazy, top notch production and as most rapper's lacks in he dosen't choose unneccesary guest features. Rapper's such as Nas, Kid Cudi and Nicki Minaj did bring some extra fire, and the coice of singer's did bring some fine hooks and catchy meleodies. He sounds more thrilled with his sophmore, he shows all more emotion with the writing and also playing off with his more comedic side.Big Sean got lines, I will be having this on replay, my interest in this dude got so much bigger thanks to this. He got some tracks I'm really loving (""Fire"", ""First Chain"", ""World Ablaze"" and the wonderful one ""Ashley""), songs like ""MILF"" and ""10 2 10"" actually worked for me too.He didn't disappoint me with this, I went in with my expectations low and he really took it with honor and proud. ""Hall of Fame"" is for sure a better one than many mainstream album's that released over the summer. As a lyricist and especially as a songwriter, Big Sean has gotten more hungrier and focused.This hasn't been giving too much plays, but we'll see were this stands in some months. A top release within the mainstram scene. Go and cop it if you like it, give it a try, could be some you like. Support hip hop!&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"
Boca Negra	Chicago Underground Duo	Rock	2010-01-26 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	81.0	CUD aren’t the first or best among many, but what you can hear when you listen to Boca Negra--in addition to a really excellent neo-jazz record--is the sounds of a band improvising while actually not really improvising. They’re unconsciously pulling from something rich and energetic and fundamental to the way we appreciate music.
Circumambulation	True Widow	Pop/Rock	2013-07-23 00:00:00	No Ripcord	83.0	Circumambulation practically evades any trace of sheen that was found on their two previous efforts. The differences are minimal but not predictable, lying somewhere between sludgy stoner metal and expansive, yet acute rhythmic precision; it’s their ability to never stand on solid ground that elevates their caliginous mid-tempo tunes.
Oracular Spectacular	MGMT	Indie	2008-01-22 00:00:00	Billboard	76.0	"Joining fellow hotly tipped Brooklyn bands Vampire Weekend and Yeasayer, MGMT (pronounced ""management"") merits just as much attention for its psychedelic experimentation as it does for its melodies and hooks."

To Willie	Phosphorescent	Indie	2009-02-03 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	78.0	The Alabama-born Houck knows his way around this music well enough to walk the fine line between respect and reverence as he delivers impassioned readings of 'Can I Sleep In Your Arms' and 'Too Sick To Pray' and kicks out a freewheeling rip through 'I Gotta Get Drunk' with the appropriate tinge of self-loathing.

Beach House responded to thisMany, including myself, wondered how beach house could possibly follow up their 2010 masterpiece Teen Dream. Beach House responded to this doubt by creating their largest and most elegant record to date, Bloom, an utter masterpiece. Bloom is one of the finest records created in the 21st century. The tracks are massive in scope, starting out small and quiet, slowly building towards their eventual greatness.I will attest to the fact that I generally consider lyrics to be very unimportant as, in my opinion, they are the most superficial aspect of music and are not representative of true musical talent or ability; however, I will fully admit that Bloom has some of the best lyrics and lyrical songwriting that I have heard; Victoria and Alex truly know how to write strong, meaningful songs.Victoria's voice on this album is absolutely incredible, she has one of the most beautiful and elegant voices in music; incredible range and a very unique timbre. She may be currently my favourite vocalist.I find the entire album to be incredible, however, if I would recommend for new listeners and previous beach house fans to check out Troublemaker, The Hours, Lazuli and Myth as these are the standouts IMO, however, like I said the entire album is incredibleAlready in May i think I have heard the best album of the year, Bloom, an album that is likely to be studied by musicians, critics and music theorists alike and recalled as the best work that of the 2000s/2010s dreampop movement.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;

The Rocky Road	Damien Dempsey	Folk	2008-08-26 00:00:00	AllMusic	79.0	The Rocky Road is well worthy of being mentioned alongside classic albums by the Dubliners and Planxty, and that's as big a compliment as it could be paid.

Music's Not for Everyone	Chain and the Gang	Pop/Rock	2011-02-22 00:00:00	AllMusic	65.0	Overall, it's a darker and more uneven album than the debut, but notwithstanding a few oddities (three reprises, and Arrington de Dionyso's Gregorian throat singing, namely), it's a respectable follow-up.

Invincible	Michael Jackson	Pop	2001-10-30 00:00:00	E! Online	51.0	The fortysomething performer doesn't have the stamina he used to, and the album quickly turns into a long run of listless ballads and silly cries for privacy.

As a singer and lyricist, though, Hammond has an openhearted, somewhat quizzical mien that's a far cry from the Strokes' poker-faced chic.
Morph The Cat	Donald Fagen	Rock	2006-03-14 00:00:00	Vinylmasters	83.0	"We all should understand that music is a totally subjective experience as is a ""good wine"" or a great movie.  That being said, I am a bitWe all should understand that music is a totally subjective experience as is a ""good wine"" or a great movie.  That being said, I am a bit perplexed that Mack would make such bold statements and references.  Steely Dan/Donald **** and Walter Becker have truly evolved.  Listen to the sound changes over the years and the past three decades have been more of a polishing of a sound that is proven, secure and dynamic.  I may be a huge fan but I also appreciate the depth and soul of what I consider to be one of the most important musical influences since James Brown - ""on the one beat - smile!  One should comment on what they understand rather than be critical of that which they do not!&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"

Meat + Bone	The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion	Pop/Rock	2012-09-18 00:00:00	The Observer (UK)	75.0	If anything, they seem to have gained funkiness on workouts such as Get Your Pants Off and the loose, classy closing instrumental, Zimgar.
Back To Land	Wooden Shjips	Pop/Rock	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	72.0	Back To Land is the most forgiving, clear album in the Wooden Shjips catalog, an interesting step for a band once lauded for their obscurity.
The Way Out	The Books	Pop/Rock	2010-07-20 00:00:00	XLR8r	81.0	It's an undefinable musical culmination of our collective conscious-reminding us that the more we've changed, the more we've stayed the same.
The Con	Tegan and Sara	Indie	2007-07-24 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	80.0	The Con is undoubtedly as sweet as it is short.

Tiger Suit	KT Tunstall	Pop/Rock	2010-10-05 00:00:00	Gus	73.0	"This is definitely her best album yet. I really don't believe that critics at all in this case. They're doing way too much comparing. JustThis is definitely her best album yet. I really don't believe that critics at all in this case. They're doing way too much comparing. Just because she had two hit singles (Suddenly I See and Black Horse and the Cherry Tree), it doesn't mean she has to live up to that or meet those musical expectations. In fact, every other song on her first album is totally different from Suddenly I See and Black Horse. Every song on ""Tiger Suit"" is beautifully crafted. Even if you don't like a particular song, you still have to appreciate it for its musical layering. Also, METACRITIC, I've seen a LOT more reviews of this album and they're not on here.

Kiss Each Other Clean	Iron & Wine	Pop/Rock	2011-01-25 00:00:00	AllMusic	77.0	Kiss Each Other Clean is the result of years of growth and change, and though that sounds incredibly boring, it's also a record full of roiling emotion, tender wit, and deeply felt melodic beauty.
Too True	Dum Dum Girls	Pop/Rock	2014-01-28 00:00:00	Blurt Magazine	72.0	At a half hour, Too True might seem brief, but Penny makes the most of every minute.
Asunder, Sweet and Other Distress	Godspeed You! Black Emperor	Pop/Rock	2015-03-31 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	84.0	Despite its brevity, Asunder has more meat on its bones. And though it calls back to many of the strengths of early GY!BE albums, it also highlights an evolution of intent.
Stuff Like That There	Yo La Tengo	Pop/Rock	2015-08-28 00:00:00	Clash Music	73.0	What ultimately makes Stuff Like That There such an appealing record is the obvious delight in performing these songs.
Easy Listening	Cobra Verde	Indie	2003-05-06 00:00:00	AllMusic	76.0	Other records from 2003 have been more innovative and certainly heavier, but Easy Listening is so golden, so upbeat and so perfectly right out of the Midwest's sleeper hotbed of rock that it simply sounds bigger than life.
Work (Work, Work)	HTRK	Electronic	2011-09-06 00:00:00	Pitchfork	62.0	There's nothing especially bad here, but once the smoke clears from their bland, bassed-out ambiance, HTRK are another band without a sound to call their own.
Somebody's Miracle	Liz Phair	Rock	2005-10-04 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	54.0	While Somebody's Miracle marks an improvement over Liz Phair, there's still nothing revolutionary, or even memorable, happening here.

Kevin Parker's main project Tame Impala got all of the attention last year, but this is his album that should have been getting the attention. It is a much stronger album, very experimental, with incredible cutting guitar riffs and beautifully brooding synths. The weird noises, the buzzes and the laser sounds fit better with this particular sound than they do on Lonerism. Beatles influences are still present, but don't dominate the record as they did on Lonerism, personally I hear more of a Radiohead influence than a Beatles influence here. I also prefer Melody Prochet's singing to Kevin Parker's but that is all personal preference as both are incredible vocalists. I think this is a much better realized album then Lonerism and is Kevin Parker's best work to date. Incredible album, fans of Tame Impala, Psychedelia and Indie Rock should love this album. 10/10, it's as perfect as an album can get!&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
This Is All Yours	Alt-J	Pop/Rock	2014-09-22 00:00:00	Pitchfork	70.0	"Mallet percussion, multilingual lyrics, chesty vocal huffs, fumbled acoustics, roundabout vocal harmonies, tentative EDM dipping, Asian monasticism, ""Rule Britannia"", American gothic: they all get sucked into the vacuum of This Is All Yours without leaving an impression."

Alice	Tom Waits	Rock	2002-05-07 00:00:00	The Wire	90.0	The sense of loss and longing becomes so physical at points that rather than respond, it's simpler to go with it until the ride ends in a drained silence. [#219, p.72]
Flowers	Joan of Arc	Indie	2009-06-09 00:00:00	AllMusic	61.0	"Joan of Arc's work on a whole generally tends to be pretty loose, but sorting through the remnants and mood pieces on Flowers can make ""Boo!

Minutes To Midnight	Linkin Park	Rock	2007-05-15 00:00:00	The Guardian	56.0	The California rap-rockers are stymied by their decision to stay roughly within the shrieky boundaries of their genre (albeit with less emphasis on the rap).

I Think We're Gonna Need A Bigger Boat	The BPA (Brighton Port Authority)	Indie	2009-01-06 00:00:00	Spin	58.0	"Iggy Pop's deadpan delivery on ""He's Frank"" sets the tone for an album that sometimes gets a little goofy, while the danceable ""Toe Jam"" pairs David Byrne with Dizzee Rascal (finally!). The lesser-known guests offer more misses than hits."

Blige	Pop	2009-12-21 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	75.0	"Blige's frequent problems with pitch control [on ""I Can See in Color""] mar what should have been the album's finest moment. Instead, the song is just indicative of the larger problem with Stronger: None of the elements that actually work ever manage to do so at the same time."
Overdrive	Shonen Knife	Pop/Rock	2014-04-15 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	67.0	There’s nothing on Overdrive that’s going to change your mind about Shonen Knife; if nothing else, it’s impressive that they’ve managed to spin so many records out of such a derivative sound.
Cupid Deluxe	Blood Orange	Pop/Rock	2013-11-19 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	75.0	Though the second half of Cupid Deluxe occasionally meanders and loses the immediacy of the first four songs, there are bright spots throughout.

We Are The Pipettes	The Pipettes	Rock	2007-10-02 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	73.0	Faux-feminist tracks such as 'Dirty Mind' are more Austin Powers than Phil Spector, too self-conscious to hit the heart-bursting heights of the originals, too much a pastiche to forge anything new.

Human Animal	Wolf Eyes	Indie	2006-09-26 00:00:00	Spin	78.0	When the clamor stays spare, the threesome's clank and bleep stumbles into beauty, and their feedback morphs toward free jazz. [Nov 2006, p.105]

Ultimately though, where all this world building and curatorship comes to fall short is where it matters most: the songs.
Roots & Echoes	The Coral	Indie	2007-08-06 00:00:00	Pitchfork	70.0	Sadly, Roots & Echoes' air of studious refinement sullies even its more cerebral material with schmaltzy gestures.
Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros	Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros	Pop/Rock	2013-07-23 00:00:00	The Observer (UK)	61.0	A bright, colour-saturated record indebted to the loopiest excesses of 60s psychedelia – but the chirpiness is wearing thin.

Bloodlines	Barbarossa	Pop/Rock	2013-08-06 00:00:00	Q Magazine	70.0	If there's a flaw, it's that Mathe's songwriting is more conventional than the arrangements. But there's no denying the emotion behind his heartfelt croon. [Sep 2013, p.97]

Codes and Keys	Death Cab for Cutie	Pop/Rock	2011-05-31 00:00:00	Under The Radar	71.0	One listen to its seventh album, Codes and Keys, reveals a band conscious as ever of the power of the studio. [May 2011, p. 77]

Teenage Hate	The Reatards	Pop/Rock	2011-05-17 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	82.0	For Jay Reatard's followers, this is a great chance to look back in the past and discover where his music started and, with the benefit of hindsight, see how it evolved. It may not win over any new fans, but the ones who followed Reatard's career should be pleased with Teenage Hate/Fuck Elvis, Here's the Reatards.
A Thing Called Divine Fits	Divine Fits	Alternative/Indie Rock	2012-08-28 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	77.0	Boeckner is occasionally overshadowed by his more charismatic collaborator, but that dynamic is nothing new to him after Wolf Parade, and there's no shame in being upstaged on a record as brisk and consistently infectious as this one.
(One)	The Panic Channel	Rock	2006-08-15 00:00:00	[Anonymous]	39.0	Anyone who has to use &#039;Avril Lavigne&#039; as why this album is good automatically has an invalid opinion. This album is disgusting.
The No Testament	Sam Carter	Folk	2012-08-20 00:00:00	BBC Music	61.0	If it were only possible to turn down the vocals, The No Testament would be a work of greater spiritual, and indeed secular, interest.
News And Tributes	The Futureheads	Indie	2006-06-13 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	71.0	News and Tributes does lack the visceral immediacy of its predecessor, and is a significant if subtle departure for the band, so it would be hard for anyone who fell in love with their debut to embrace it immediately. But, given time, the record gets under your skin in slow and somewhat surprising ways, eventually coming off sounding like a very good transitional album by a group with a whole lot more staying power than most would have credited them with two years ago.
Chase This Light	Jimmy Eat World	Rock	2007-10-16 00:00:00	Hot Press	66.0	Chase This Light is not a genre-defying album for the history books–-it just gives the impression that Jimmy Eat World are still capable of producing one.

Red Devil Dawn	Crooked Fingers	Indie	2003-01-21 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	82.0	Bachmann&#146;s transition from indie curmudgeon to singer-songwriter is complete: his arrangements are now horn- and string-fattened creations of grand sophistication; his songs now contain hope and broken spirit simultaneously; but the most significant growth displayed on Red Devil Dawn, and the reason this album is Bachmann&#146;s finest moment since his Barry Black days, is that you can now see Eric Bachmann as the subject of most of his songs.
The Golden Age of Knowhere	Funeral Party	Pop/Rock	2011-03-29 00:00:00	PopMatters	65.0	"Sadly, though, Golden Age of Knowhere peaks at the beginning and slides gradually downhill from the moment ""New York City Moves to the Sound of LA"" ends."
Wild Flag	Wild Flag	Pop/Rock	2011-09-13 00:00:00	Pitchfork	83.0	For all the ideological intent fuelling the Wild Flag mission, the band rarely sacrifices the rock'n'roll fun-- they no doubt deliver that elusive black-and-blue, but it's a hit that feels like a kiss.
Goblin	Tyler, The Creator	Rap	2011-05-10 00:00:00	The Independent on Sunday (UK)	72.0	His second solo album, while often truly horrible, is also fascinating and funny.
Romantic Comedy	Big Troubles	Pop/Rock	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM)	71.0	The record too often seems unsure of itself, the band uncertain of their ability to make this style of music conform to their rules rather than vice versa--a shame considering how talented Craig and Drennan are when it comes to melody and song.
Who You Are	Jessie J	Pop	2011-04-12 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	51.0	Unfortunately, the songs on Who You Are that allow Jessie J's ugly, born-that-way vocals to cut loose are in the distinct minority. In the quest to find herself, she seems to have gotten sidetracked.

The Best Little Secrets Are Kept	Louis XIV	Indie	2005-03-22 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	62.0	It's hard to shake the empty feeling at the end of each these songs; The Best Little Secrets Are Kept has an inescapable, intentional tawdriness.

Bubblegum	Clinic	Pop/Rock	2010-10-05 00:00:00	No Ripcord	73.0	If you've embraced Clinic's reverberating panache for the past ten years, there's no reason to dislike Bubblegum's peculiar fabric. This is the sound of a unit that still has no intention in keeping up with the times, delivering more of what they do best with an already proven track record.
Bounce	Bon Jovi	Rock	2002-10-08 00:00:00	Q Magazine	61.0	Bounce is the sound of a group who know what they're good at and why. [Nov 2002, p.97]

Spirit	Apse	Indie	2008-08-19 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	79.0	What impresses most is the flowing musicality, the invention, the subtlety of many of the effects.
No Kings	Doomtree	Rap	2011-11-22 00:00:00	The Boston Phoenix	80.0	The songs justify further replay and analysis just because the group knows how to deliver consistently smart, compelling imagery.
I Think We're Gonna Need A Bigger Boat	The BPA (Brighton Port Authority)	Indie	2009-01-06 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	58.0	The beats are dandy, tweaked-up period pieces from Sixties ska to Eighties R&B.; But song albums, as opposed to DJ mixes, need good songs.
In The Zone	Britney Spears	Dance	2003-11-18 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	66.0	Especially without the aid of visuals, Spears remains a chilly nonentity who gets upstaged by her surroundings, but there are worse things for her to be than window dressing for some of the most state-of-the-art beats money can buy.
Eating Us	Black Moth Super Rainbow	Indie	2009-05-26 00:00:00	Spin	74.0	Woozy, smoked-out hooks are strewn like cigarette butts--a Black Moth specialty that Fridmann dials up throughout this consistently twisted half-hour and change.
Unpredictable	Jamie Foxx	R&B;	2005-12-20 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	52.0	Foxx's music and range of vocal techniques are not unique, but perhaps this added touch of genuine, heartfelt realism is what will see the actor make a successful jump into the music industry.
Lonely Avenue	Nick Hornby	Pop/Rock	2010-09-28 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	63.0	"Formal knowledge works against them as they go from unfunny Randy Newman (""Levi Johnston's Blues"") to too-cute Barry Manilow (""Belinda"") to overdone Elvis Costello (""Password,"" about breaking into a girlfriend's e-mail)."
Hardcourage	FaltyDL	Pop/Rock	2013-01-21 00:00:00	Resident Advisor	78.0	"Hardcourage is not necessarily his most exciting music--in fact it gets a little sleepy after a while. But once you're drifting away to the dreamy ""Bells,"" as it saunters half-lidded to a close, you might wonder if that's actually the point."
Divine Operating System	Supreme Beings Of Leisure	Dance	2002-09-10 00:00:00	JackT	69.0	Amazing! So good.
They Threw Us in a Trench and Stuck a Monument On Top	Liars	Indie	2002-08-20 00:00:00	Blender	77.0	Liars are more about energy than solid songwriting, but these spastic, jagged grooves are powerful enough to inspire a sea of awkward punk-rock dances. [#9, p.150]
Laugh Now, Cry Later	Ice Cube	Rap	2006-06-06 00:00:00	RapReviews.com	59.0	By bringing his beats up to date he may not only win back some old fans but convert a few new ones in the process by showing them he's more than just a Hollywood actor.

Within and Without	Washed Out	Pop/Rock	2011-07-12 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	70.0	"They've succeeded in making an album that does well to second-guess its listener, whilst never disowning the sound that first brought Greene to the foreground.

Magnetic	Goo Goo Dolls	Pop/Rock	2013-06-11 00:00:00	Classic Rock Magazine	57.0	Magnetic may veer close to Maroon-5-at-their-very-best territory, but let's not get sniffy. It's a life affirming, joyful record. [Jun 2013, p.91]
Hercules And Love Affair	Hercules & Love Affair	Dance	2008-06-24 00:00:00	Uncut	86.0	This is inventive harkening, not witless revivalism. [Apr 2008, p.90]

The Raven That Refused to Sing and Other Stories	Steven Wilson	Pop/Rock	2013-02-26 00:00:00	jmneeley06	77.0	"A remarkable record that should easily the ""best of 2013"" list in most music goers. Steven Wilson has truly outdone himself here. Highly recommend it!"
Out Into The Snow	Simon Joyner	Indie	2009-09-15 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	69.0	"“The Drunken Boat” one of the best tracks he’s done to date. The rest of the album isn’t as daring or unique. Joyner mostly follows the ""Hotel Lives"" template and reaps the same rewards."

We Started Nothing	The Ting Tings	Rock	2008-06-03 00:00:00	Pitchfork	64.0	Maybe once the Ting Tings stop trying so hard to convince everyone they're having a good time and start actually having a good time, these cute little ballads will no longer be their sole redeeming quality.
Hip Hop Is Dead	Nas	Rap	2006-12-19 00:00:00	The Guardian	79.0	You don't have to agree with the prognosis (even Nas has a change of heart by the end) to relish the furious eloquence with which it's delivered.
Ivory Tower	Chilly Gonzales	Electronic	2010-09-14 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	68.0	Produced by Boyz Noize, this is the sound of a rook shuffling with a maverick king, full of harpsichords and pianos and sexy European beats; it will arouse the mind and stimulate interesting positions.
MM..Food	MF Doom	Indie	2004-11-16 00:00:00	Pitchfork	81.0	If Mm..Food? feels merely good or somewhat inconsequential, it's because it is that way by design.

The Obliterati	Mission of Burma	Indie	2006-05-23 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	81.0	The Obliterati is underwhelming not because it's bad, or weak, or mediocre, because it's none of those: it's just not essential.
FIDLAR	FIDLAR	Jazz	2013-01-22 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	72.0	Without [Kate Nash collaboration Awkward], Fidlar is still an electrifying, intensely fun album. But with it, it would have been perfect.
1,000 Years	The Corin Tucker Band	Pop/Rock	2010-10-05 00:00:00	Los Angeles Times	76.0	1,000 Years is a determined effort to go beyond a somewhat burdensome past--and a statement that Tucker is eager to express what's both beautiful and difficult about full adulthood.
Dynamite	Jamiroquai	Rock	2005-09-20 00:00:00	Urb	61.0	Jay Kay sounds more vital and energized than he has in a few albums. [Sep 2005, p.108]

Screws Get Loose	Those Darlins	Pop/Rock	2011-03-29 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	76.0	Everybody takes turns singing lead. And beneath all the rudimentary clank and buzz, there's plenty of rockabilly quiver, drawl and twang.
The Party Ain't Over	Wanda Jackson	Country	2011-01-25 00:00:00	Spin	66.0	"For ""Shakin' All Over,"" White runs Jackson's goblin-queen croak through the analog fetishist's version of Auto-Tune, while ""Rum and Coca Cola"" rides the most lopsided punk-calypso groove since Kid Creole and the Coconuts."
Weightlifting	Trash Can Sinatras	Indie	2004-08-31 00:00:00	Billboard	81.0	"The Trashcans toil on their songs, and at times, it shows -- but all it takes is the 4:10 melodic blizzard of ""All the Dark Horses"" to sum up what all that sweat was about: birthing pure bliss."

Everything Is 4	Jason Derulo	Pop	2015-06-02 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	67.0	"Occasionally, the more ambitious nature of Everything Is 4 reveals some of Derulo's weaknesses, like his insistence on indulging straight R&B; (which feels basic compared to the unique mode of genre-bending he usually works in), but stretching musically also leads to arguably the most exciting moment here, the funk rave-up of album-closer ""X2CU."""
Bitter Tea	The Fiery Furnaces	Indie	2006-04-18 00:00:00	Blender	69.0	The album's an impossible mess, but so lively that it's worth sifting through the shrapnel for the tasty bits. [May 2006, p.106]
My Old, Familiar Friend	Brendan Benson	Indie	2009-08-18 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	72.0	My Old Familiar Friend seems to be an album with modest aspirations which, for the most part, it achieves.

It Had to Be You... The Great American Songbook	Rod Stewart	Pop	2002-10-22 00:00:00	Uncut	42.0	The arrangements are banal, but the tunes are exquisite, and his voice, more worn now, is recorded intimately. [Dec 2002, p.148]
Psychic Chasms	Neon Indian	Electronic	2009-10-13 00:00:00	PopMatters	81.0	Never ominous and always bright, Psychic Chasms is fantastic brain candy in the vein of electronica or millennial psychedelia.
9th Ward Pickin' Parlor	Shawn Mullins	Rock	2006-02-14 00:00:00	Uncut	64.0	Mullins is a solid, occasionally platitudinous songwriter whose rustic tales don't approach the wry, wise gifts of similar artists like Johns Prine and Hiatt. [Mar 2006, p.88]
Blood Pressures	The Kills	Pop/Rock	2011-04-05 00:00:00	Pitchfork	76.0	The new album feels at once a return to the Kills' beatbox-blues origins as well an attempt to broaden their palette with more sensitive, intimate turns.
Sleep Forever	Crocodiles	Pop/Rock	2010-09-14 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	69.0	Sleep Forever, if anything, is an assurance of their staying power; they could probably get away with releasing this same record throughout the remainder of their career.
Lost Wisdom	Mount Eerie	Indie	2008-10-07 00:00:00	Pitchfork	82.0	The result is a collection of songs so taut and concisely resonant as to be psalms.
LP1	FKA Twigs	Pop/Rock	2014-08-12 00:00:00	The Guardian	86.0	It has its flaws--as you might have intuited from the videos and press shots, they largely stem from trying a bit too hard--but you leave it convinced that FKA Twigs is an artist possessed of a genuinely strong and unique vision, one that doesn't need bolstering with an aura of mystique.
Satisfied at Last	Joe Ely	Country	2011-06-07 00:00:00	Uncut	57.0	"He may not quite be the roaring pistolero of old, but mid-tempo songs like ""Mockingbird Hill"" and ""The Highway Is My Home"" are beautiful, time-ruffled distillations of border music, Tex-mex and desert rock. [Oct 2011, p.94]"
Modern Times	Bob Dylan	Rock	2006-08-29 00:00:00	Los Angeles Times	89.0	This swinging, sometimes mournful, often tender set of 10 songs proves an easy album to, well, love. [25 Aug 2006]
Tones Of Town	Field Music	Indie	2007-02-13 00:00:00	Mojo	80.0	The result is 31 minutes of constantly surprising music, more absorbing and less conventional than anything on their self-titled 2005 debut. [Feb 2007, p.102]
Landing	Githead	Rock	2009-11-10 00:00:00	Uncut	67.0	For their third album, Githead -  that's Wire's Colin Newman, Robin 'Scanner' Rimbaud, and Malka Spigel and Max Franken of Israeli post-punkers Minimal Compact - have partly abandoned the sly hooks of 2007's well-named Art Pop In favour of a leaner and more ambient approach. [Jan 2010, p. 112]
Junip	Junip	Pop/Rock	2013-04-23 00:00:00	Q Magazine	75.0	These considered songs are slow to blossom but, like Junip, they're worth the wait. [May 2013, p.104]
Jeff Bridges	Jeff Bridges	Country	2011-08-16 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	65.0	Jeff Bridges is all quiet and sepia-toned, dripping like molasses in dollops of hammy pedal steel, placid acoustic guitars, and Bridges' cracked vocal chords.
Seeing Things	Jakob Dylan	Rock	2008-06-10 00:00:00	Billboard	75.0	Under Rubin's direction, Dylan's laid-back rasp, often laced with smoky harmonies, gains weight and texture.
Lacuna	Childhood	Pop/Rock	2014-08-11 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	68.0	It’s clear that, especially now they’ve released Lacuna, Childhood are indeed making the right kind of noises that’ll ably assist them in making that important career leap from dreamy infancy to artistic maturity.
Finisterre	Saint Etienne	Rock	2002-10-22 00:00:00	PopMatters	73.0	At its best, Finisterre finds Saint Etienne exploring new moods within their familiar formula of '60s acoustic sounds meet '90s electronica rhythms; at its worst, which is far more often, it clumsily grafts hip-hop and electro-synth on to the group's increasingly shopworn pop hooks.
Human After All	Daft Punk	Electronic	2005-03-15 00:00:00	Village Voice	57.0	Human After All is determinedly monochromatic aurally, compositionally, and mood-wise. Gosh, they really are robots--the music is flat, barely inflected, sitting there like a vending machine waiting patiently for your quarters.
All of Us, Together	Teen Daze	Electronic	2012-06-05 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	60.0	While the album, at times, feels a bit monochromatic, it maintains its intrigue and never loses its vision.
Song Of The Pearl	Arbouretum	Indie	2009-03-10 00:00:00	The Boston Phoenix	72.0	Song of the Pearl may not be full of surprises, but it provides a fresh trip through familiar territory that's more than idle nostalgia.

A Letter Home	Neil Young	Folk	2014-05-27 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	69.0	As a whole, Young and White have managed to make an album that’s absolutely useful with a recording process that is absolutely central to that use.
Joyland	Trust	Electronic	2014-03-04 00:00:00	BloodyPenguin	72.0	This is NOT TRST 2.0.  It is more complex and smoother than the debut album.

Double Demon	Starlicker	Jazz	2011-06-10 00:00:00	The Wire	80.0	Sum's bigger than the parts, though, and Double Demon delivers a whack of sound and a level of detail far in excess of anything on earlier ESO and Sound Is Delmarks. [Aug 2011, p.70]

Departing	The Rural Alberta Advantage	Pop/Rock	2011-03-01 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	75.0	The songwriting is another matter. Where debut album Hometowns was saturated with specific references to Alberta, with little cinematic details that helped to flesh out the songs, Departing relies too frequently on stock winter imagery and generic love laments.
Embrace	Sleepy Sun	Rock	2009-07-07 00:00:00	Dot Music	71.0	So, while this is a terrific rock record, there's still not much here that our dads didn't nod-out to at Bickershaw.

The  Carpenter	The Avett Brothers	Folk	2012-09-11 00:00:00	Absolute Punk (Staff reviews)	72.0	What we're left with is an album that sounds like something of an identity crisis.

The Law Of Large Numbers	Emma Pollock	Rock	2010-03-02 00:00:00	Delusions of Adequacy	72.0	The numerous instruments, varied influences and genre-hopping arrangements on The Law Of Large Numbers, along with Pollock’s own musical talents, results in some emotive indie-rock whose repeated plays will be justified and rewarded.
Diver	Lemonade	Pop/Rock	2012-05-29 00:00:00	Delusions of Adequacy	64.0	An intoxicating brand of synth-pop that's slicker than a Gordon Gekko coif.
You Get What You Give	Zac Brown Band	Country	2010-09-21 00:00:00	Absolute Punk (Staff reviews)	80.0	Though You Get What You Give is not their strongest offering to date, it certainly points to a most promising future. And that in and of itself is probably all the music world really needs.

Blacklisted	Neko Case	Indie	2002-08-20 00:00:00	Village Voice	82.0	Blacklisted is soaked to the bone in rueful wit, luxurious miserablism, and morbid cold sweat&#151;c&w; virtues too often reduced to self-pity by lesser latter-day sweethearts of the rodeo.
Familiars	The Antlers	Pop/Rock	2014-06-17 00:00:00	The 405	82.0	Familiars is bleak and dreary, potentially at the cost of dragging in certain spots. However, those willing to spend enough time wrapped in its moody embrace will be rewarded with a quite beautiful experience.

Still, the musical content (including Kasher&#039;s voice usage) was impeccable. It was powerful, the beats were complex and original, the horns were a nice touch, although still not as good as the strings from Ugly Organ, and everything blended together well very nicely. If Kasher would&#039;ve opted to stick to lyrics that make him appear older than 14, I would have given it a 10.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;

Lost In the Dream	The War on Drugs	Pop/Rock	2014-03-18 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	86.0	Granduciel is clearly still drawn to his rock roots, but as the gap between him and those influences widens, it become suffused with anxiety and dread, the sort of existential ambivalence that Lost in the Dream masterfully conveys with its vast distorted spaces.

Return of the Century	The 1900s	Pop/Rock	2010-11-02 00:00:00	Pitchfork	75.0	If the sentiments are tough, the music itself is tender, borrowing from Belle & Sebastian and Brill Building pop to create a sound that is both pastoral and urbane, straightforward yet sophisticated.
Hypnotized	Dream Police	Pop/Rock	2014-11-11 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	70.0	While many of the ideas on Hypnotized are promising, many are also beaten to death.
Takk...	Sigur Rós	Indie	2005-09-13 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	84.0	I always felt as if those moments of triumph in the band’s music were the focal points, the “good stuff” you waited for and wanted to arrive and then stay forever. This time around though, they appear to have taken a backseat to the band’s darker impulses, and staggeringly, Takk sounds all the better for it.

Locked Down	Dr. John	Pop/Rock	2012-04-03 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	86.0	"The album is at once classic and modern, and while it's short on timeless songs like ""Glowin',"" ""Loop Garoo"" and ""Mos' Scocious,"" on the whole it's a more engaged, eclectic, and ornery set than these types of revivalist projects usually are."

Like you'll see in most reviews of this band, these guys are obviously big 80's early 90's indie fans. The influence of The Smiths and My Bloody Valentine is prominent. The guitar playing is reasonably simple and the vocals aren't great - really low, but there is something about this album that I really like that I can't quite put my finger on. It's far from a classic but it's not got any bad tracks on it, its full of upbeat indie pop and it. The singles Hey Paul and Everything With You kind of embody everything about this record so if your looking for a taster before you dive in check those out.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;

Without Your Love	oOoOO	Electronic	2013-06-25 00:00:00	Derezzination	69.0	"The album is dark. So dark that the album packaging itself reflects this. The front and back covers are black with grey writing that makes itThe album is dark. So dark that the album packaging itself reflects this. The front and back covers are black with grey writing that makes it hard to see, and if you squint at the front cover, then you can make out trees; the album is a thick fog concealing it's centre. The album feels very discreet though, because of this fog, for it is reflected in the music.The ambient sounds of children and birds, simple sounds that will encounter in life become haunting in the production on the songs within Without Your Love. oOoOO's previous work has been dark on his previous E.P's, but on this full-length, he really captures a certain aspect of beauty within the music and it feels very calming at points, especially at the end of ""Sirens"" and the last song ""Across a Sea"".This chilling sounds infects ""Stay Here"" but spreads itself out over the rest of the album, in a way that makes the songs feel similar, but you know that they are different songs. This is a bit troublesome because on the one hand I'm thinking, ""Hold on, haven't I just heard this?"" contrasted with ""This album actually really well together because of this."" It has flow. The desolate synths create a sense of loneliness and the deep bass creates a party where there is no light, just people dancing blindly.I like the vocal cuttings on ""3:51 am"", and I wish there was more on the album, but we do get some very eerie reversed vocals on ""Crossed Wires"" which work very well.The ""Witch House"" micro-genre or whatever people call it seems to, with this album, be dying. This album really sees to kill it off in the best way possible. I feel that this album is the start of what is to come out of the ashes of ""Witch House"", and I will be interested to see what happens with Dark Electronic music. It has the gloom, and it has the depressive oppressive sound that you can crave for. It's not in your face, but it is brilliant subtlety. Your friend won't, on first listen, or even on a passing listen be blown away, but he will be haunted by it, he will fall into it's awe. You won't to hand this to a friend and say, ""You know what, try this.""&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"

Minotaur	The Clientele	Pop/Rock	2010-08-31 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	73.0	All considered, Minotaur is thoroughly pretty and easy to appreciate on a compositional level; the usual blend of modern-era indie pop with iconic '60s sensibilities. But it's like that particular horse has been beaten past recognition, rendering Minotaur a little too safe for its own good.
Evolve or Be Extinct	Wiley	Rap	2012-01-19 00:00:00	PopMatters	73.0	Evolve or be Extinct succeeds as both a collection of songs for public use--dancing, drinking, celebrating Christmas, protesting customs officials--and as a complex portrait of the artist who's sacrificed his sleep and sanity to create them.

I Have Hands	The Bran Flakes	Indie	2009-02-24 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	61.0	Unfortunately, it takes quite a bit of effort to sift through 30 such songs to find the more immediately arresting moments. The sugar-rush aesthetic grows tiresome over the course of the record and threatens to overshadow the more sublime moments.
Disc-Overy	Tinie Tempah	Rap	2011-05-17 00:00:00	The Telegraph (UK)	72.0	A sensational debut from the British rapper. Tempah's wit, imagery and rhythmic flow is offset by schoolboy humour and a tendency to build raps from non sequiturs.

Fuck Off Get Free We Pour Light on Everything	Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra	Pop/Rock	2014-01-21 00:00:00	No Ripcord	78.0	It has all their trademarks--simultaneously elaborate and raw, idiosyncratically punk-rock, dedicated to chronicling the unrelenting ugliness of western society--but this time little of it sticks.
Commencement	Deadsy	Rock	2002-05-14 00:00:00	RoxanneM.	56.0	The sound of Elijah&#039;s voice just makes you quiver because its so beautiful and the music sends shivers down my spine.
Frying on This Rock	White Hills	Pop/Rock	2012-03-20 00:00:00	Uncut	72.0	On their second release for Thrill Jockey they sometimes clear space in the pummeling blizzard of delay, fuzz and reverb. [Apr 2012, p.88]
Gravity the Seducer	Ladytron	Electronic	2011-09-13 00:00:00	Blurt Magazine	68.0	If Witching Hour was the finest apple the band ever produced, this is their finest orange. But as a whole, it probably is their best and most well-rounded record.

I also like how the disc has no filler, as most rap/hip hop albums do these days. I don&#039;t know where I read it, but the only real downside I agree with is that Brother Ali is serious all the time-never really funny or joking around. I&#039;d say this is definitely worth owning!&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Curse Your Branches	David Bazan	Indie	2009-09-01 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	82.0	For all the talk that's been made recently of Bazan's own struggles with alcoholism and faith, it's telling that on Branches the strongest, most evocative tracks are those that, in the singer's beautifully worn and warm delivery, choose, in essence, melody over meaning.
Observator	The Raveonettes	Alternative/Indie Rock	2012-09-11 00:00:00	DIY Magazine	73.0	Overall the album is never really present enough to make an impression, beyond a hazy silhouette in the distance.

One Track Mind	Psychic Ills	Pop/Rock	2013-02-19 00:00:00	CMJ	70.0	Ten years into their career, Psychic Ills have tamed themselves, refining into a form, but the result remains a hypnotic set of songs that consistently achieve an introspective and cerebral kind of psychedelia.
World Painted Blood	Slayer	Rock	2009-11-03 00:00:00	CradleCOBHC	78.0	World Painted Blood is one hell of an album. Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman have once again managed to write some **** riffs and songs WorldWorld Painted Blood is one hell of an album. Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman have once again managed to write some **** riffs and songs World Painted Blood, Unit 731, Beauty Through Order, Hate Worldwide and Playing With Dolls have to be this album's highlights. It seems like this time Slayer managed to write 2 songs that they will perform for sure on many of their lives even after the album's promo tour is over and these are World Painted Blood and Hate Worldwide. Overall the album has some awesome, evil riffness and you can expect many of the riffs and melodic parts of the guitar to be replaying in you head over and over again. Still, the quartet that is Slayer did not achieve making an album that would reach the epicness of Reign in Blood or Seasons in The Abyss. But i think what Slayer tried to do with this release is return back to their roots but not making it look too much with the old stuff. This release receives a 7 out of 10 for me.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Mojo	Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers	Rock	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	72.0	It's slightly indulgent at more than an hour long, but more likely that's just Petty's way of offering love for what his ageless band can do.
Totale Nite	Merchandise	Pop/Rock	2013-04-02 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	71.0	While Totale Nite doesn’t tip toe around its skewed sensibilities, Merchandise demonstrates a healthy knack for turning its weirder, darker musical instincts into something palatable.
Escondida	Jolie Holland	Indie	2004-04-27 00:00:00	E! Online	83.0	Holland gracefully achieves the spookiness and timelessness artists like Tori Amos and Cat Power have been chasing for years.
Liberation	Trans Am	Indie	2004-02-17 00:00:00	Logo	65.0	&#145;Liberation&#146; is the most damning indictment of the Bush administration yet recorded, and it&#146;s all subliminal. Magnificent.
Moon Landing	James Blunt	Pop/Rock	2013-11-05 00:00:00	The Independent (UK)	49.0	"Rothrock does a decent job of pumping life into Blunt's material, building a song such as ""Bonfire Heart"" from fingerstyle guitar opening to big, exultant conclusion by way of subtle accretions. Not that he has much to play with."
Barragán	Blonde Redhead	Pop/Rock	2014-09-02 00:00:00	Boston Globe	64.0	There’s plenty of occasion for beauty here throughout, but the band seems intent on disrupting the pleasant view.

Omni	Minus the Bear	Indie	2010-05-04 00:00:00	Mojo	65.0	While the band's strength lies in inventiveness of their composition, the end result isn't as enjoyable  to hear as it surely was to make. [Sep 2010, p.102]
Duper Sessions	Sondre Lerche	Indie	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	70.0	It's a cute idea, except that Lerche's jazz-tinged pop is more compelling than his pop-tinged jazz. [24 Mar 2006, p.70]
You Gotta Go There To Come Back	Stereophonics	Rock	2003-09-09 00:00:00	Mojo	60.0	The lyrics are full of fleeting assignations and gruff, bumper-sticker wisdoms, apparently seeking to draw hard-bitten romance from the business of being in a band. [Jul 2003, p.107]
The Delivery Man	Elvis Costello	Rock	2004-09-21 00:00:00	Playlouder	71.0	A collection of rehashed moments from his brilliant though patchy career, a sowed together patchwork of pastiche.

Pom Pom	Ariel Pink	Pop/Rock	2014-11-17 00:00:00	The Guardian	75.0	It sounds like pop music made by someone who feels pop music is beneath him, deliberately crowding out his obvious abilities with stupid voices and noises, layering on the irony to mask his own insecurities about what he does.
The '59 Sound	The Gaslight Anthem	Rock	2008-08-19 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	77.0	It even sounds like producer Ted Hutt tried to mimic Jon Landau’s production, since singer Brian Fallon sounds like he’s singing through vintage mics. It works incredibly well, though, as Gaslight earnestly blast through 12 tracks of melodic punk.
My Dinosaur Life	Motion City Soundtrack	Rock	2010-01-19 00:00:00	Spin	79.0	My Dinosaur Life, on which the band strikes a radio-ready balance between mayhem and melody, may well trigger their long-awaited breakthrough.
I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning	Bright Eyes	Indie	2005-01-25 00:00:00	Blender	85.0	Despite all the lonely missives and political outrage, Oberst comes off more like a troubadour of hope. [Mar 2005, p.132]
Dead Throne	The Devil Wears Prada	Pop/Rock	2011-09-13 00:00:00	Alternative Press	76.0	While modern metalcore acts are a dime a dozen now, the fourth full-length from the Devil Wears Prada should lay waste to any usurpers attempting to seize their rightful crown. [Oct 2011, p.107]
Bonfires On The Heath	The Clientele	Indie	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Under The Radar	81.0	At this point the band has mastered its studied simplicity. [Fall 2009, p.57]
Mysteries	Tigercats	Pop/Rock	2015-03-10 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	70.0	Mysteries is by no means terrible, but Tigercats are a long way from earning their stripes.
Brave Tin Soldiers	Sarah Nixey	Pop/Rock	2011-06-21 00:00:00	The Independent on Sunday (UK)	76.0	The second Nixey solo album is a thing of subtle gorgeousness, with Nixey's none-more-English, sexy school-mistress diction dealing with topics as bleakly improbable as the Bridgend teenage suicides.
Sisyphus	Sisyphus	Pop/Rock	2014-03-18 00:00:00	Pitchfork	64.0	While “Dishes in the Sink” and its companion ballad “Hardly Hanging On” tell a genuinely affecting story of squalor and depression. Despite these peaks, Sisyphus is more fun to ponder than it is to listen to.
Cryptomnesia	El Grupo Nuevo de Omar Rodriguez Lopez	Rock	2009-05-05 00:00:00	Pitchfork	62.0	Awe is in the ear of the beholder, sure, but after being predictably pounded into the ground for half an hour by Rodriguez-Lopez/Hill et al. and their bag of heavy tricks, it's hard to tell if we're meant to walk away impressed or oppressed.
Ultraista	Ultraista	Pop/Rock	2012-10-02 00:00:00	The Guardian	64.0	The album sounds weirdly uniform, the over-similarity perhaps the result of avoiding choruses in favour of repetitive mantras.

Compare it to what you want but in my opinion it is nothing else but TCTC. They have created their own sound, (no its not radiohead or oasis or whatever some reviewers are saying) obviously influenced by these reviewers comparisons but these influences have not left footprints in the actual music. This album is why I listen to music and almost nothing goes even near it.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Contra	Vampire Weekend	Indie	2010-01-12 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	81.0	The 10 songs here don't collectively match the near-perfection displayed on the band's debut, but Contra is varied and vivacious enough to make each spin as revelatory as the first time you realized what the band was getting away with and how well it pulled off the feat.
You're the One	Paul Simon	Rock	2000-10-03 00:00:00	Sonicnet	76.0	"I readily admit I was confused by its unusual instrumental combinations, by the turn-on-a-dime melodies and rhythms, and the ""still searching after all these years"" lyrics -- by its relentless eclecticism. Still, I kept listening, and at the end of the day found myself having trouble escaping these meandering, insinuating songs."
In And Out Of Control	The Raveonettes	Indie	2009-10-06 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	74.0	It turns out to be much more than just the sum of its influences. It's evocative when it could just be shamelessly retro.

Rainwater Cassette Exchange	Deerhunter	Indie	2009-06-09 00:00:00	Delusions of Adequacy	80.0	While their LPs are again, consistently, some of the year’s best albums, it is definitely true that their EPs are no slouches either.
Collapse into Now	R.E.M.	Pop/Rock	2011-03-08 00:00:00	Dot Music	71.0	Collapse Into Now isn't a bad album but crucially it isn't a classic.
The Sound The Speed The Light	Mission of Burma	Rock	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Uncut	74.0	"What's remarkable though, is the seamless way in which they carried on from where they left off after their two-decade hiatus: although this sounds modern, it still has enough of their early urgency, once more balancing the anthemic (""SSL83"", ""One Day We Will Live There"") with a thrilling sense of a band about to career off-course at any moment. [Jan 2010, p. 121]"
Somewhere Beautiful [Live]	The Chills	Pop/Rock	2013-10-15 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	76.0	In the final assessment what we’ve got here are a set of pop songs that are almost uniformly brilliant, captured in a fashion that harks back to the band’s beginnings, presented beautifully and with pride.

God Hates Us All	Slayer	Rock	2001-09-11 00:00:00	PopMatters	80.0	Slayer do what they do with impassioned authority, which is what makes an album full of vileness so compelling.
Maniac Meat	Tobacco	Electronic	2010-05-25 00:00:00	Under The Radar	69.0	Maniac Meat  has some huge structural risks that might leave some listeners looking for the more accessible sounds of his more established band. But, in almost every case, those gambles pay off quite well with an unpredictable romp through a sweaty psychedelic swamp. [Spring 2010, p.66]
Queensrÿche [2013]	Queensrÿche	Pop/Rock	2013-06-25 00:00:00	blindguardian	75.0	"So... what to say about this album... No really, what is there to even talk about?

It's not as if the music is messy, or bad, or anything truly awful by any stretch of the imagination. It's just not unique. But the most baffling thing is that this album is being hailed as a ""triumphant return"" for Queensryche. The lyrics lie somewhere between progressive and nonsensical, the solos don't really offer that much, and the rhythm guitarist is the same as with most bands; utterly useless. While the drumming isn't exactly complex, it does it's job, and Todd La Torre can be impressive on vocals as long as you take out the track ""Redemption"" where he's autotuned to death. I really don't understand the praise this album has been getting. It's possible that it just need to take a little more time to grow on me, but this album truly feels like it's lacking something really special. This eponymous album can unfortunately go in the pile of American metal albums that have tread this same, cheesy ground hundreds of times before.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"

True Love Cast Out All Evil	Roky Erickson With Okkervil River	Rock	2010-04-20 00:00:00	BBC Music	82.0	An extension of the rehabilitation that the 63-year-old has undergone in the last decade, under the devoted guidance of family and friends, it's a record that both addresses and somehow transcends his past.
All The Lost Souls	James Blunt	Rock	2007-09-18 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	53.0	Lost improves on the first disc at least five times over, partly because its starker focus might really take you back to...well, certainly not a club, but maybe an AM radio-equipped kid's bedroom circa 1973.

Strangers to Ourselves	Modest Mouse	Pop/Rock	2015-03-17 00:00:00	Pretty Much Amazing	70.0	Strangers isn’t bottled lightning like The Moon & Antarctica or The Lonesome Crowded West, nor does it contain a magnitude 9 single like Good News or Ship, but its unwieldy stature and combative stance compliments Modest Mouse’s storied discography.
The Id	Macy Gray	Pop	2001-09-18 00:00:00	E! Online	71.0	"Musically, the album bounces from a full-on urban polka (""Oblivion"") to tracks with plenty of Apollo Showtime-style organs, horns and disco and funk elements that keep the wacky tales from sounding wack."
The Rainbow Children	Prince	Rock	2001-11-20 00:00:00	Uncut	54.0	The music, though lithe and limber in a jazz-fusion-funk bag, lacks melodic distinction, while the vocals are delivered in a variety of electronically treated styles that are irritating at first and increasingly so on repeated exposures.

How I Long To Feel That Summer In My Heart	Gorky's Zygotic Mynci	Rock	2001-09-18 00:00:00	PopMatters	79.0	How I Long to Feel That Summer in My Heart further underscores how brilliantly anomalous and unfashionably brilliant GZM are.

The fact is that all the tracks bar the final one are strong, fun, catchy and thrilling psych-rock. You can tell Pond do not take themselves too seriously and it comes across in their music, and never more so than here. If you were feeling melancholic before sticking this album on you will feel much better by the end.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
The Believer	Rhett Miller	Rock	2006-02-28 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	64.0	These fluid, unfussy songs don't quite stick in your gut the way the 97's' best stuff does, but give Miller a chance and he can charm you something fierce.

Duets: Re-Working the Catalogue	Van Morrison	Pop/Rock	2015-03-23 00:00:00	American Songwriter	65.0	His singing partners, all of whom bring their “A” game. They help make what could have been a forgettable, tossed off, commercially driven, contract fulfilling item into one of the singer’s more memorable projects. And with a catalog as rich and deep as Van Morrison’s, that’s high praise indeed.
Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned	The Prodigy	Electronic	2004-09-14 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	53.0	Were Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned released in 1999 when everyone else was releasing their mediocre post-big beat follow-up album, though it would still be unlistenable, it would also be excusable.

Their sense of humor is definately reflected in their music. if this music doesn&#039;t satisfy your inner frustrations with digitally enhanced bass and vocals, go back to your little ""woe is me"" linkin park music. this album is fun. they&#039;re not trying to make a statement they&#039;re just doing what they love. and if you think this album is a piece of trash, email me YOUR music and i&#039;ll tell you what I think.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"
Beyond	Dinosaur Jr.	Rock	2007-05-01 00:00:00	Mojo	79.0	Beyond is the better-produced natural successor to 1987's epochal You're Living All Over Me. [May 2007, p.104]
Acid Rap	Chance the Rapper	Rap	2013-04-30 00:00:00	XXL	86.0	Ultimately, Acid Rap’s biggest victory is living up to it’s own hype and Chance’s careful packaging of his artistry.
Chrome Dreams II	Neil Young	Rock	2007-10-23 00:00:00	The Boston Phoenix	76.0	Chrome Dreams II is effective despite the sonic clash because, on both the new material and the leftovers, the loud ('Spirit Road') and the soft (the soul ballad 'Ever After'), it’s unified by its call to give props to spirit and humanity, a sentiment that, whatever it’s wrapped in, never gets old.
Archive 2003-2006	Department of Eagles	Pop/Rock	2010-07-20 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	70.0	Archives will not compensate for the lack of new Department Of Eagles material. Indeed, it appears that the project will be on a long hiatus whilst Rossen is preoccupied by Grizzly Bear. Yet it does have merit as a fascinating document of a band veering out of its comfort zone, starting to make what had previously been the music of their dreams.
Veronica Falls	Veronica Falls	Pop/Rock	2011-09-20 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	71.0	For an album with no discernible weak links--we'll deduct a mark simply because half these songs were previously available--the final quarter is where Veronica Falls finds itself elevated alongside 2011's best.

Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty	Big Boi	Rap	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Village Voice	90.0	The resulting, mercifully final product is, as you might have suspected all along, fantastic, by turns triumphant, defiant, and gleefully crass.
One of Us Is the Killer	The Dillinger Escape Plan	Pop/Rock	2013-05-14 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	79.0	Overall, since their formation in 1997, The Dillinger Escape Plan have seamlessly fused math metal with aspects of pop and jazz, a trend that wholeheartedly continues on One Of Us Is The Killer.
Hospitality	Hospitality	Pop/Rock	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Under The Radar	75.0	The Brooklyn's quartet vacillates between Camera Obscura's mawkish indie-pop, Regina Spektor's endearing flirtations and The Clientele's autumnal vision. [#39, p.68]

Voices	Phantogram	Pop/Rock	2014-02-18 00:00:00	The Line of Best Fit	74.0	The band fails to keep up that feverish tempo, and the album’s bewitching beginning quickly gives way to less inspired, repetitive numbers that plague a majority of the record, especially its weak second half.
Human Bell	Human Bell	Indie	2008-01-29 00:00:00	AllMusic	61.0	It sounds counterintuitive, but the unconventional nature of Human Bell is the very thing that holds it back.

Pushin' Against a Stone	Valerie June	Folk	2013-08-13 00:00:00	Boston Globe	81.0	As debuts go, this is a marvel by a singer and songwriter who has no desire to fit snugly into one category. Her talent isn’t that easily contained.

The Sweet Escape	Gwen Stefani	Rock	2006-12-05 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	58.0	Even Linda Perry, Swizz Beatz, Nellee Hooper and the Neptunes have their share of duff tracks, and it appears that's all they had to offer when Stefani came calling.
Self Help Serenade	Marjorie Fair	Indie	2005-07-19 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	68.0	Self Help Serenade is not an unpleasant listen; it has simply and unfortunately been played out over the years by scores of other bands.
No Wow	The Kills	Indie	2005-03-08 00:00:00	Q Magazine	78.0	An even more spare-sounding album. [Mar 2005, p.100]

Wavering Radiant	Isis	Rock	2009-05-05 00:00:00	Sputnikmusic	79.0	To attempt to rank Wavering Radiant within the Isis discography is to miss this point. Fans of earlier releases will likely be disappointed but if this record proves anything, it's that Isis are a fully-functioning organism, slowly moving towards something not yet known by the listener and perhaps not even the band themselves.
Everything Is	Nine Black Alps	Indie	2006-02-28 00:00:00	Alternative Press	68.0	9BA have a sense of urgency that should appeal both to Anglophiles and to punk scenesters who also inexplicably like Oasis. [Apr 2006, p.216]
A Sleep & a Forgetting	Islands	Pop/Rock	2012-02-14 00:00:00	Filter	69.0	The album is a bit of a departure for Islands in sound and even more so in content, but rather than a misstep, A Sleep & A Forgetting fits neatly within the band's catalog.
Live in Memphis	Big Star	Pop/Rock	2014-11-04 00:00:00	Mojo	76.0	A true treasure from the archives. [Dec 2014, p.109]
Come Into My House	No Kids	Indie	2008-02-19 00:00:00	PopMatters	68.0	The energy of the instrumental arrangements here are enough to carry the bulk of Come Into My House‘s twelve cuts to satisfactory ends, even if they are lacking in emotional handlebars to grip on to.
Night Time, My Time	Sky Ferreira	Pop/Rock	2013-10-29 00:00:00	Pitchfork	79.0	Night Time, My Time isn’t the reactionarily somber anti-pop drag it could have been--instead, it’s a smart Kelly Kapowski hair-whip and loud bubblegum-crack of a record that lends itself to compulsive listening.
Steal Your Face	Mi Ami	Rock	2010-04-06 00:00:00	XLR8r	74.0	"Mi Ami continues to explore its loose-groove, jam-band tendencies on the epic ""Dreamers"" and album closer ""Slow,"" but in far more reserved quantities than Watersports, making for a much more exciting and immediately lovable listen."
Carter Girl	Carlene Carter	Country	2014-04-08 00:00:00	The Guardian	81.0	Carlene has revived their songs before, but never with this intensity and emotion.
Bee Hives	Broken Social Scene	Indie	2004-03-23 00:00:00	Alternative Press	70.0	The instrumentals falter. [Jun 2004, p.97]
On the Water	Future Islands	Pop/Rock	2011-10-11 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	80.0	Water is leagues more mature than last year's In Evening Air--the production more robust, the lyrics more evocative of people who've been around long enough to know what's worth lamenting.
Last Exit	Junior Boys	Indie	2004-09-21 00:00:00	[Anonymous]	89.0	Overall it&#039;s great.

The minimal production adds much-needed sheen and elegance to the tired synth-pop formula, and parts, like the beautiful sighs of the title track, take your breath away. But the juxtaposition of quiet, breathy vocals and almost dancefloor-oriented beats sometimes creates an uncomfortable juxtaposition; it&#039;s almost as if there&#039;s no perfect place to listen to this record. I&#039;d love for this to be a record to listen to quietly with headphones in the dark, but the sudden stabs of synth often jar me out of the state of total relaxation I feel the album is trying to create. However, the second disc from the US version is absolutely sublime: Unbirthday clears away layers from the original birthday, stripping it down to its beautiful core, and the two remixes are the finest songs I&#039;ve heard in 2004. So that&#039;s an 8 for the first disc and a 10 for the second.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Shock Value II	Timbaland	Rock	2009-12-08 00:00:00	The New York Times	50.0	The productions flaunt Timbaland trademarks: vocal sounds imitating turntable scratching, quick keyboard arabesques, grunts as percussion. But now he fills in the spaces that made his old tracks so startling.
Syndrome Syndrome	Gardland	Electronic	2013-10-29 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	73.0	A better way to appreciate the record isn’t in one beefy sitting, but rather in bitesize portions. Devour it slowly and you’ll be able to savour its flavour.
Transgender Dysphoria Blues	Against Me!	Pop/Rock	2014-01-21 00:00:00	awkwardhenry	82.0	User score of 5.7??? Really? What the hell... Perhaps this has something to do with this being Laura's first album since she came out. Anyway,User score of 5.7??? Really? What the hell... Perhaps this has something to do with this being Laura's first album since she came out. Anyway, I find this album phenomenal. Much better and more emotional than White Crosses, which I also loved, this is Against Me!'s best album since Reinventing Axl Rose. It's more punk than anything in between then and now as well. Not only is this the rawest expression of angst in years, it's also an incredible exploration into the lives of people with gender dysphoria.  Not only is this a musical achievement, but a social one as well.  Maybe in ten years when all the transphobic nonsense has died down, this album will be seen as the masterpiece that it is!!!&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Snowflake Midnight	Mercury Rev	Indie	2008-09-30 00:00:00	PopMatters	67.0	Mercury Rev haven’t quite mastered this new toolkit they’ve taken on, and their proggy/bombastic/unabashedly emotional side makes them hard to swallow for some.
Mantaray	Siouxsie	Rock	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	72.0	"The moments of ""hey, that sounds a bit like ..."" are few, but notable; and perhaps unavoidable with such a distinctive vocal presence. In any case, these are welcome echoes from the past, not a weary retracing of footsteps."
Minotaur	The Clientele	Pop/Rock	2010-08-31 00:00:00	AllMusic	73.0	Minotaur is as essential as anything else the band has released and whether as part of Bonfires or on its own, the record stands as a welcome addition to their legacy as one of the great indie pop bands of their era.
Ronnie Dunn	Ronnie Dunn	Country	2011-06-07 00:00:00	Los Angeles Times	70.0	The duo's taller half, Ronnie Dunn, was long regarded as the more distinctive singer, and on his solo debut, there's no more sharing of the spotlight to hold him back. That's about the only difference between a Brooks & Dunn record and this similarly hit-and-miss collection of odes to blue-collar empathy, patriotism and the transformative power of love.
Direct Hits	The Killers	Pop/Rock	2013-11-11 00:00:00	Magnet	71.0	Their grandiose mini-operas and stadium-size choruses can thrill. But to hear the relentless string of outsized anthems in a row is exhausting. [No. 105, p.55]
We Were Dead Before The Ship Even Sank	Modest Mouse	Indie	2007-03-20 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	78.0	Brock’s idiosyncratic worldview, so much a part of what made Modest Mouse special to begin with, has left the building.
Seeing Things	Jakob Dylan	Rock	2008-06-10 00:00:00	AllMusic	75.0	In Rubin's hands, Seeing Things plays like a songwriter playing his newest songs in your living room--a seductive feeling that no Wallflowers record ever captured, which is an excellent reason for Dylan to step out on his own.
Under the Blacklight	Rilo Kiley	Indie	2007-08-21 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	71.0	The one thing you can't accuse Under the Blacklight of is being boring, but it abides by an either/or sort of mentality that presumes that a complete lack of substance is the only alternative to the kind of music Rilo Kiley and their pals made in 2002.
Ugly	Screaming Females	Pop/Rock	2012-04-03 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	83.0	Indie rock albums with this uniquely developed a voice don't come around often, especially not when it's this much fun.
Book Of Bad Breaks	Thee More Shallows	Indie	2007-04-24 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	69.0	It’s a loud and cacophonous affair—where previous efforts doled out their noise in judicious restraint, Breaks responds to their need to unhinge their fractured pop.
The Child of Lov	The Child of Lov	Rap	2013-05-06 00:00:00	Q Magazine	74.0	Not all the tracks have the same impact, however, and a certain sameness in tone saps thrills. [Jun 2013, p.95]
Wayward Fire	The Chain Gang of 1974	Pop/Rock	2011-06-21 00:00:00	Alternative Press	68.0	Mohager ultimately forgets there's a fine line between homage and aping, but if your dream gift is a time capsule from the Reagan Years get ready to discover your new favorite record. [Jul 2011, p.107]
I Don't Like Shit: I Don't Go Outside	Earl Sweatshirt	Rap	2015-03-23 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	81.0	The little dude is a poet. Still, at a relatively lean 30 minutes, it’s hard to argue this is a heavyweight album.
Blood Money	Tom Waits	Rock	2002-05-07 00:00:00	CultureDose.net	84.0	If the young, brooding Waits had done this score it would have been too much--too miserable--but our older, wiser Waits possesses the perfect combination of cynicism and idealism to pull it off.

Undercard	The Extra Lens	Pop/Rock	2010-10-19 00:00:00	Under The Radar	77.0	It's often Darnielle's immaculate attention to detail that understandably garners the most praise, yet here it's Bruno's complementary productions that deflates any stuffiness and affords these tracks a chance to breathe, making Undercard a welcome addition to both men's illustrious catalogues.

Good Things	Aloe Blacc	Rap	2010-09-28 00:00:00	Mojo	82.0	Blacc's wise-beyond-his-years tenor, sounding eerily alike a young Bill Withers, perfectly fits I Need A Dollar's dignified mourn. Elsewhere, he skillfully evades mawkishness or trite sentiment on the moving Momma Hold My Hand. [Sep 2010, p.106]
Retriever	Ron Sexsmith	Indie	2004-04-06 00:00:00	Mojo	79.0	It is a pleasure to report that nothing has changed. [Jun 2004, p.108]
Garden Ruin	Calexico	Indie	2006-04-11 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	75.0	Despite the occasional moment when Garden Ruin sounds like a garden-variety alt-country-rock album, its moments of pure Calexico charm outweigh its missteps.
Romance Is Boring	Los Campesinos!	Indie	2010-01-26 00:00:00	Spin	75.0	Romance, their third album in 24 months, is more slickly assured -- and far less twee -- than its predecessors.
Night Works	Layo & Bushwacka!	Dance	2002-09-10 00:00:00	Blender	79.0	May demand close listening compared to the boisterous immediacy of most dance efforts, but it proves utterly entrancing. [#10, p.120]
Mirrorwriting	Jamie Woon	Electronic	2012-01-31 00:00:00	AllMusic	70.0	Mirrorwriting is an encouraging first offering which should neatly fill the spacious, indie R&B; gap until the XX's next record comes along, but if it could have sustained the quality of its opening six tracks, it could have been much better.
Sweat	Nelly	Rap	2004-09-14 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	67.0	The main thing 'Sweat' has going for it is the fact that it isn't 'Suit.' [2 Oct 2004, p.63]
Let It Reign	Carl Barât	Pop/Rock	2015-02-17 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	67.0	"There's still enough of the Libertines' Arcadian ideal across tracks like ""Summer in the Trenches"" and the title track to hold old fans firm, but unlike Dirty Pretty Things, Barat's initial post-Libs' effort, he may have finally given the Albion his personal touch."
Mockingbird Time	The Jayhawks	Pop/Rock	2011-09-20 00:00:00	Blurt Magazine	70.0	The trademark ingredients that turned Hollywood Town Hall and Tomorrow the Green Grass into seminal classics are retained via Olson's yearning vocals, the sun splashed harmonies and their adept meld of Americana, vintage West Coast rock, strings and psychedelia.
Beet, Maize & Corn	High Llamas	Indie	2003-10-07 00:00:00	AllMusic	73.0	Beet, Maize & Corn is a dramatic reinvention of the High Llamas.

Transistor Rhythm	Addison Groove	Electronic	2012-04-02 00:00:00	The Quietus	70.0	"It's only at this point, [""Incredible Exhausted Bunny Ears""]... that Transistor Rhythm actually feels vital, resulting in in a luscious closing suite to an otherwise arid record."
Getaway	The Clean	Indie	2001-08-21 00:00:00	The Wire	76.0	It's fair to say that not much new ground is broken here, but it's remarkable how endearing their blend of chugging underground pop and frail ragas still sounds. [#210, p.66]
Beauty Behind the Madness	The Weeknd	R&B;	2015-08-28 00:00:00	AllMusic	74.0	The commercial strides are obvious. The creative advancements are less apparent, obstructed by some unappealing measures, but they're in there.
Do It Again	Röyksopp	Pop	2014-05-26 00:00:00	Exclaim	76.0	Röyksopp and Robyn have not only traversed new territory, they've made it their own.
Build a Rocket Boys!	Elbow	Pop/Rock	2011-04-12 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	82.0	Specifically speaking, Elbow have retained their crowns as everyman kings.
Musik, Die Schwer Zu Twerk	Electric Würms	Pop/Rock	2014-08-19 00:00:00	Pitchfork	64.0	Oddly, for an album that cheekily presents itself as a long-lost ’70s prog cut-out bin artifact, Musik, die Schwer zu Twerk’s most notable characteristic may be its 29-minute brevity, offering a tasting-menu sampler of the various modes the Lips have been exploring for the past five years.
Non Stop Erotik	Black Francis	Rock	2010-03-30 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	70.0	It's a slight album, but by the standards he himself set, and patchy Black Francis is better than no Black Francis at all.
Underneath	The Verve Pipe	Rock	2001-09-25 00:00:00	Armand	63.0	Amazing album from one of the most underrated, unappreciated bands of our generation. Every song is incredible!
Yours Truly	Sublime with Rome	Pop/Rock	2011-07-12 00:00:00	AllMusic	48.0	Yours Truly doesn't quite match the caliber of the albums in the Sublime discography, but it's a fairly enjoyable spin-off just the same.

Systems/Layers	Rachel's	Indie	2003-10-07 00:00:00	Pitchfork	81.0	It's a brilliant ambient musical experience-- you can tune it out if you choose and it'll still enhance your surroundings, or you can engage yourself fully and allow it to positively hypnotize you.
The Black Parade	My Chemical Romance	Rock	2006-10-24 00:00:00	The Guardian	79.0	The most bonkers album of the year, but one of the best.

I tried giving them a second chance by ordering 'The Proxmity Effect,' but to my dismay, I was told that my order was cancelled since the album would not be released. I figured they would fade into obscurity at that point. Much to my surprise, several years later and they have released a few more albums, in my opinion, each one better than the last. For me, 'Lucky' is about as good as it gets. It's hard for me to listen to this and come out feeling down, or to feel like I was taken on an overly exhausting musical journey. It's cautiously optimistic and lighthearted enough for you to just play it through without getting too emotionally bogged down. Yet, it definitely engages you, makes you think and more importantly, makes you feel. It's kind of an exhilarating experience, and although it may have to grow on you a bit, it's really hard to be dissappointed with this great effort.  I will let you peruse the critic reviews for more detailed comments, but the standout tracks for me are ""See These Bones,"" ""The Fox,"" and ""Beautiful Beat.""&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"

King Night	Salem	Electronic	2010-09-28 00:00:00	Spin	72.0	Seedy, feel-bad music. Half-dead, sometimes gorgeous, and willfully dumb beyond repair. Call it alienation porn. Sound awful? Well, it is kind of awful--and rivetingly so.
Trans-Continental Hustle	Gogol Bordello	Rock	2010-04-27 00:00:00	AllMusic	72.0	There's plenty good here, that's undeniable, but the album lacks the spark to push it forward and place it at the top.
I Feel Cream	Peaches	Rock	2009-05-05 00:00:00	Observer Music Monthly	74.0	Ideology aside, this is a diverse album that retains her trademark dirty electro but on collaborations with Simian Mobile Disco still delights.

I way the guitar sings is so sexy and moody, and the lead singers voice is sexy and moody as well.

Stars Dance	Selena Gomez	Pop	2013-07-23 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	59.0	It boasts a harsher, edgier sound than that of her previous efforts; on every other front, it's a lazy, bloated, and occasionally offensive album that lacks any remnant of personality or creativity.
Graduation	Kanye West	Rap	2007-09-11 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	79.0	Thing is, though, that for every failure Graduation puts me through it has many a saving merit that only the nigh witless audacity of Kanye West could afford
Lux	Brian Eno	Electronic	2012-11-13 00:00:00	The Observer (UK)	75.0	It is an engaging antidote to all the frantic maximalism that the future keeps springing.
Collapse into Now	R.E.M.	Pop/Rock	2011-03-08 00:00:00	No Ripcord	71.0	The album clearly bounces back and forth between those moments of emotional annihilation and utter hope and optimism.  But more than that, with those tracks book-ending the effort, the record's most basic motif is clear: even as lords of rock, the men of R.E.M. still struggle daily with their own issues and the standards of the world, but welcome the battle with ever-glowing smiles.

Terraplane	Steve Earle & the Dukes	Country	2015-02-17 00:00:00	PopMatters	69.0	Terraplane is a respectful homage by a gifted singer and songwriter, but it only intermittently provides the pleasures of a topnotch blues record.

The Broken String	Bishop Allen	Indie	2007-07-24 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	78.0	Longer listeners will be impressed with the band’s evolution but will inevitably be let down with the lack of charm in these new recordings as opposed to their looser demo cuts.
Soft Control	Laura Welsh	Pop/Rock	2015-03-10 00:00:00	The Line of Best Fit	61.0	Whilst there are echoes of the bluster of Florence and the Machine and the minimalist soul of Jessie Ware here, Soft Control is a distinctive take on modern pop and an album with crossover appeal.

Honkey Kong	Apathy	Rap	2011-08-23 00:00:00	RapReviews.com	82.0	He's versatile enough in writing ability to cover any topic from somber to silly, he's clever enough to make what he has to say worth rewinding to catch, and he's not that bad behind the boards as a producer either

Venus Doom	H.I.M.	Rock	2007-09-18 00:00:00	AllMusic	67.0	H.I.M. isn't a band known for profound lyrics, but, at the same time, most fans of the band don't want to philosophize, they want to hear the group rock out, and this release shows them doing precisely that, even harder than before.
The Invisible Way	Low	Pop/Rock	2013-03-19 00:00:00	BBC Music	80.0	Produced by Wilco's Jeff Tweedy, The Invisible Way is warm and organic, melodic and fragile. Twenty years into their career, and Low have created one of their best albums yet.
This Gift	Sons and Daughters	Rock	2008-01-29 00:00:00	AllMusic	73.0	Really though, just about any song could be singled out for praise.

Let's Dance Raw	Shintaro Sakamoto	Pop/Rock	2014-09-16 00:00:00	Pitchfork	63.0	Raw is a perfectly executed version of what Westerners might call global kitsch: a series of evocative tourist postcards showing sunny scenes from Rio and Honolulu.

Blurry Blue Mountain	Giant Sand	Country	2010-11-23 00:00:00	Clash Music	73.0	Rich, detailed, and poetic, Blurry Blue Mountain explores human emotion and the meaning of life like the great writers of old. Gelb has been around a long time, and on the basis of this he will be for a long time to come.
Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers & Bastards	Tom Waits	Rock	2006-11-21 00:00:00	AllMusic	92.0	Orphans is a major work that goes beyond the origins of the material and drags everything past and present with sound and texture into a present to be presented as something utterly new, beyond anything he has previously issued.

Face The Truth	Stephen Malkmus	Indie	2005-05-24 00:00:00	Magnet	78.0	Too stylistically diverse, willfully weird and lyrically cryptic to be anything more than an acquired taste. [#68, p.101]
Can Cladders	High Llamas	Indie	2007-02-20 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	74.0	Tracks like 'Bacaroo' and 'Sailing Bells' deploy the sort of lovely string arrangements that sweep you off your feet and have your knickers on the floor before you even notice your cold bits.

Why love Chance? He is crazy, goofy, and funny, but also introspective, value oriented, and deeply caring of what happens to his family and the community he is apart of. He's the type of rapper to talk about how its been a ""long time"" since he's seen his grandmother smile, then turn around and ask the ""f*!# you talm bout"" if you come at him the wrong way because of what his city has taught him. That's a little of what we get from #10Day, which I believe deserves at least a 7 out of 10 due to its sheer amount of different from what the mainstream provides. Then he gives us Acid Rap. As the title suggests, its a little bit trippy, but not in a negative way. On this mixtape, Chance fans should immediately notice the increased level of production, a slightly more mature Chance since high school evidenced by songs like ""Paranoia(second half of Pusha Man),  ""Lost,"" ""Everybody's Something"", and ""Acid Rain"", and a rapper that still lets us know he's down to party and have fun on songs like ""Juice,"" ""Smoke Again,"" ""Nana,"" and ""Favorite Song."" We even get a bit of both on the songs ""Cocoa Butter Kisses"" and ""Chain Smoker."" The order of the mixtape is well put together, beginning with a hyped kind of intro and ending with a mellowed out, yet slightly hyped outro. Fitting, because that fits the mood of how the tracks transition in the order of the tape. He's in your face. He wants to be your hero because he's worried problems of a troubled community, and he's both, an aspiring ""Captain-save-a-hood"" indeed.  Although his voice is quite different from most of the mainstream, perhaps it needs to be to catch the average listeners attention, maybe not. He is defiantly  an artist that does take adjustment to, so that his always present signature high pitched screech of a voice may be enjoyed. Once the voice barrier is passed, its then all about his lyrics and the beats, both appropriately placed on ""Acid Rap."" He successfully gives the listener a clear picture of growing up in a troubled Chicago community, presenting a scared but nevertheless caring young man that wants everyone to know his story, and hopefully create some change. So. Good message. Not overly simplistic, developed beats. And lyrics that can alternately fit at a party or a deep thinking session. Sounds like a top-notch mixtape to me&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"

Peaceful, The World Lays Me Down	Noah and the Whale	Indie	2008-09-16 00:00:00	Dot Music	60.0	Perhaps it's just that the rest of the songs aren't up to scratch, but this album is a simple case of diminishing returns--what appeared carefree and sparkly-eyed to begin with feels more and more calculated as you go on, what first seemed endearing ends up feeling a little irritating.
Olympia	Austra	Pop/Rock	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Q Magazine	76.0	The plush, throbbing synths and twinkling tension that filled Feel It Break are conjured again here, but there's a subtle shift this time in the dynamic and Olympia's power lies in its marimba-infused percussion. [Aug 2013, p.93]

White Chalk	PJ Harvey	Rock	2007-09-25 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	80.0	On the largely piano-based White Chalk, she retreats into an odd little-girl-lost persona, singing almost entirely in a tremulous higher key that strangles the most powerful instrument in her arsenal: that voice.
Elephant Shoe	Arab Strap	Indie	2000-06-06 00:00:00	Pitchfork	78.0	Arab Strap's music is still fractured, Smog-like, and woefully beautiful. The group's pitted, narky ambience fuses Irvine Welsh with Brian Eno's Another Green World-- Elephant Shoe is ambient for the Tamazipan massive.... Arab Strap's depression is as addictive as their expression of it is alluring.

Indie Cindy	Pixies	Pop/Rock	2014-04-29 00:00:00	American Songwriter	62.0	On Indie Cindy, there’s not a lot of danger, or passion--or excitement for that matter.
Hurry Up, We're Dreaming	M83	Electronic	2011-10-18 00:00:00	Uncut	76.0	After a moment of comparative restraint he returns with a double album so spectacularly grandiose you have to wear 3D specs to hear it properly. [Nov 2011, p.91]
Love This Giant	David Byrne & St. Vincent	Indie	2012-09-11 00:00:00	The Independent (UK)	77.0	There's a danger of art-rock overload in this alliance of two cerebral music talents, but Love This Giant succeeds remarkably well.
Still Night, Still Light	Au Revoir Simone	Indie	2009-05-19 00:00:00	The Boston Phoenix	71.0	"Some bands make a third album; others make something more like a third refinement of ""the album."" This feels like the (charmed) latter."
Motion: Connected Works	Koen Holtkamp	Electronic	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Uncut	77.0	Motion files nicely alongside Fripp & Eno, or Klaus Schulze, a set of rippling, drowsy circuitry, laminated with silvery guitar drones. [Apr 2014, p.76]
Funeral	Arcade Fire	Indie	2004-09-14 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	90.0	Funeral's layering of sound and wide-eyed posing can be overly dense, and though the band utilizes nice melodies and lively arrangements, the nostalgia-steeped-indie-rock-orchestra pool was pretty much drained before The Arcade Fire dove in.
Quality Control	Jurassic 5	Rap	2000-06-06 00:00:00	Mark:-)	77.0	Mark is... impressed and satisfiel by this work of fun genius!
Baby 81	Black Rebel Motorcycle Club	Indie	2007-05-01 00:00:00	Alternative Press	71.0	The bulk of Baby 81 draws from the dark underbelly of the Woodstock generation. [Jun 2007, p.156]
Sum/One	bEEdEEgEE	Electronic	2013-12-03 00:00:00	XLR8r	68.0	Knowing what he is capable of with his band, though, one can't help but feel a little unfulfilled by his solo effort. If anything, SUM/ONE's moments of constriction emphasize how vital the expansive jam aspect is to Gang Gang Dance.
Her Blurry Pictures	Mathew Jonson	Electronic	2013-06-11 00:00:00	XLR8r	78.0	An effortless, catatonic undercurrent carries listeners through Her Blurry Pictures and somehow, it manages to put the subliminal neuroticism of Mathew Jonson's music at the center of the listening experience while remaining pleasant to listen to.
God Bless Your Black Heart	The Paper Chase	Indie	2004-06-08 00:00:00	The Wire	73.0	Voyeurs of the disintegration of the human condition will be able to gorge on vicarious thrills to their black heart's content. [#246, p.62]

I Don't Want To Let You Down [EP]	Sharon Van Etten	Pop/Rock	2015-06-09 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	83.0	These are slow, sad ballads brilliantly executed.
XXXX	You Say Party! We Say Die!	Indie	2010-02-09 00:00:00	Under The Radar	75.0	A calm but affirming end to an album brimming with energy may seem a sort of juxtaposition, but it works so well with an album that is practically a live show in itself. [Winter 2010, p.70]
David Archuleta	David Archuleta	Rock	2008-11-11 00:00:00	The New York Times	58.0	The music, made by many producers and songwriters, averages out different forms of radio-format blandness, with tinges of Coldplay and Shania Twain, and a few dollops of good writing. But the persona remains intact, ready for more.
Early Fragments	Fear of Men	Pop/Rock	2013-02-12 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	84.0	The contents of Early Fragments display exactly what the cover promises: a beautiful set of songs that don’t quite fit together, more variations on a theme than a unified album.
Looks At The Bird	Brokeback	Indie	2003-01-21 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	68.0	It&#146;s all quite beautiful and inoffensive, and that in itself may be an admirable goal. But what it lacks is the experimental--or at least, improvisatory--bent of Tortoise, as well as lacking a lot of what made the last Brokeback record so great.
Life After Defo	Deptford Goth	Pop/Rock	2013-03-19 00:00:00	The Line of Best Fit	69.0	Life After Defo is a truly captivating debut, with a poignancy that lasts far beyond the first listen.

In Between Dreams	Jack Johnson	Rock	2005-03-01 00:00:00	Mojo	58.0	A rare feat: gentle and kind without becoming soppy or daft. [May 2005, p.109]
Chrome Dreams II	Neil Young	Rock	2007-10-23 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	76.0	"Seven new songs polish Chrome Dreams II, which glides past Young's well-meaning but flaccid new millennial output--""Are You Passionate?"" (2002), ""Greendale"" (2003), and ""Living With War"" (2006)--in pulling alongside 2005's ""Prairie Wind,"" and near some aforementioned career peaks."
The Road And The Radio	Kenny Chesney	Country	2005-11-08 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	57.0	He sounds ragged, out of tune in places. He simply doesn't sing as well as he used to.
Lines, Vines and Trying Times	Jonas Brothers	Rock	2009-06-16 00:00:00	No Ripcord	56.0	Lines, Vines and Trying Times isn’t a good record and definitely isn’t the kind of thing you should be looking to investigate further. But if you’re reading this review, the chances are it’s not meant for you, so giving it a thumbs-down is hardly earth-shattering news.
The Flood	Of Mice & Men	Pop/Rock	2011-06-14 00:00:00	TheQuietGamer	70.0	If you're a fan of Of Mice & Men then there's no doubt you'll love this album. For those of you metal fans who haven't heard of this band thisIf you're a fan of Of Mice & Men then there's no doubt you'll love this album. For those of you metal fans who haven't heard of this band this is an excellent album to start with. What impressed me most with this album is how the band managed to flawlessly transition between angry screams to melodic rock several times in one song. Even more impressive is how they made it feel natural. It really shows you how much talent these guys have. They use it to their advantage to with their lyrics by using the two different styles to show two different sides of the song. The Flood is an impressive and most importantly enjoyable CD that's worth the purchase.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Sound-Dust	Stereolab	Rock	2001-08-28 00:00:00	E! Online	71.0	Is a welcoming entrance for new fans as much as it is another fine chapter for the diehards.
Georgia	Georgia	Electronic	2015-08-07 00:00:00	Clash Music	80.0	It's palpable that the tracks are more at home on the stage, where you can feel the frenetic energy of the record itself, Georgia's boisterous on-stage persona coming through in abundance. On record, sometimes that energy gets lost in a noisy ether, her identity chopped and screwed into fragments.
The Slip	Nine Inch Nails	Rock	2008-07-22 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	78.0	The hard-hitting early tracks '1,000,000,' 'Letting You,' and 'Discipline' are particularly good, though typical; Reznor keeps farming the same fertile ground that yielded The Slip's predecessors.
Soft Airplane	Chad VanGaalen	Indie	2008-09-09 00:00:00	Delusions of Adequacy	74.0	His most complete album to date, Chad Van Gaalen's Soft Airplane carries aisles of contradictions through turbulence and diffused sunlight. Here, the talented artist plays to his strengths.
Warnings/Promises	Idlewild	Rock	2005-08-16 00:00:00	Dot Music	66.0	Woomble’s lyrics, while literate, are never quite as clever as his supporters would like to believe.
Favourite Worst Nightmare	Arctic Monkeys	Indie	2007-04-24 00:00:00	BBC collective	82.0	Turner’s sharp narrative ear is still tuned to the revealing banalities of everyday life, the whole band admirably responsive to emotional nuance.

Manners	Passion Pit	Indie	2009-05-19 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	76.0	Passion Pit's full-length debut proves he isn't fronting: It's a shiny bouquet of synth-pop roses, with perfumed Eighties keyboard whooshes and modern stutter beats crooking a finger toward the dance floor.
Transmission	Gay Dad	Indie	2002-04-30 00:00:00	AllMusic	52.0	Transmission, while marginally stronger than the band's debut, forgets to bring along the same natural pop drive and offers more of the same well-honed faux iconic babble, and regularly stoops to the equivalent of a Love record with improper squelch control.

Mark Kozelek & Desertshore	Mark Kozelek	Pop/Rock	2013-08-20 00:00:00	Pitchfork	78.0	It's arguably his best of the calendar year, thanks to strong songs as well as the band’s sensitive accompaniment. Rather than evoke the romanticism of the road (as Sun Kil Moon did on 2003’s Ghosts of Great Highway) or the emotional detachment of touring life (as Kozelek does on every live album), Desertshore pry open his brain and soundtrack his thoughts.
Pain Is Love	Ja Rule	Rap	2001-10-02 00:00:00	AllMusic	59.0	What makes it a slightly better album than Rule 3:36, though, is the album's consistency.
Pop Ambient 2014	Various Artists	Electronic	2014-02-04 00:00:00	XLR8r	74.0	As a series, Pop Ambient may gradually be losing its vitality, but its musical perspective does not have to. Moving forward, an adjustment to the delivery platform would do much to make Pop Ambient's sound more relevant.
Retriever	Ron Sexsmith	Indie	2004-04-06 00:00:00	The New York Times	79.0	Chiming 1960's folk-rock and Beatles-tinged melodies can't quite pull Ron Sexsmith out of the moderate despair that suffuses his songs.
On Your Own Love Again	Jessica Pratt	Folk	2015-01-27 00:00:00	Uncut	79.0	These are new songs that sound like the old songs, the kind you might treasure 'til your vinyl is pockmarked and warped. [Feb 2015, p.86]
Blacklisted	Neko Case	Indie	2002-08-20 00:00:00	Blender	82.0	Case's own melodies aren't nearly as indelible as the country classics she's emulating. [#10, p.115]

The Snake	Wildbirds & Peacedrums	Rock	2009-08-25 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	80.0	At times The Snake sounds like a drum solo with vocals, but they make their limited line-up sound endlessly malleable, which is no small feat.
The Book of Souls	Iron Maiden	Pop/Rock	2015-09-04 00:00:00	Q Magazine	80.0	Their 16th LP is their most challenging to date. For all the fine musicianship and vaulting ambition, though, there are lengthy longueurs. [Oct 2015, p.111]
Barter 6	Young Thug	Rap	2015-04-16 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	72.0	Barter 6 feels like a step in the right direction rather than a destination, proof that Thugger can put together a complete package even if it’s less than adventurous.
They Threw Us in a Trench and Stuck a Monument On Top	Liars	Indie	2002-08-20 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	77.0	While their found object gimmickry is a novel enough enticement, the Liars' solid stop/start rhythm section is what keeps the junkyard noise spastically danceable.

House of Woo	Maxmillion Dunbar	Electronic	2013-02-18 00:00:00	XLR8r	79.0	Field-Pickering isn't yet the type to release a grand album statement, but so far, his best moments have been the monolithic ones. Now, it's just a matter of amassing enough of them for a long-player.

Royal Blood	Royal Blood	Pop/Rock	2014-08-25 00:00:00	DIY Magazine	77.0	Even with a debut album, their ascent has been so steep the opening salvo feels like a premature greatest hits.
Here We Are	Citizens	Pop/Rock	2012-06-12 00:00:00	Q Magazine	69.0	Tom Burke's voice is perfect for the role of geek Lothario with a dozen clever ways to get the girl, and yet just as convincing when , on the sad-sack swoon of I Wouldn't Want To, heartbreak wipes off the smirk. [Jul 2012, p.97]

Fortunately, while Exercises doesn't reach that level, it comes close enough to keep everyone not only interested, but invested.
Boy In Da Corner	Dizzee Rascal	Electronic	2004-01-20 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	92.0	Most of Boy in Da Corner's most compelling moments come from this uneasy interaction between irrational youth and ultra-rational mechanized society.
Without Feathers	The Stills	Indie	2006-05-09 00:00:00	Playlouder	65.0	Former admirers, be warned that 'Without Feathers' will send you into a headless, flailing flap; while any newcomers to The Stills will be left with a plump, bald turkey on their hands.
Left	Hope Of The States	Rock	2006-06-19 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	61.0	Noble and determined, 'Left' proves that while HOTS are capable of stirring thoughts and emotions, it's only when they reach full throttle that they truly move hearts and minds.
Ladyhawke	Ladyhawke	Indie	2008-09-22 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	70.0	We can quibble about intent and expression, but in the end you will have to succumb to the heart, body and soul, and your brain might be left behind.

Emika	Emika	Electronic	2011-10-11 00:00:00	The Observer (UK)	78.0	[The album] is an intriguing work: dark, seductive and as hard to pin down as its creator.
The Dutchess	Fergie	Pop	2006-09-19 00:00:00	Los Angeles Times	58.0	The problem is the Duchess herself. Fergie exudes earthy charm, but can't keep up with the breakneck music. She forces emotion on the slower show-stoppers, and she's all cartoon kitten on the come-ons. [17 Sep 2006]

Raw Power [Reissue]	Iggy & the Stooges	Rock	2010-04-13 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	92.0	"So many Stooges live sets and outtakes are already available that the bonuses risk redundancy (and there's an even longer ""Deluxe Edition"" available via mail-order), but Raw Power itself remains a landmark."
Foreverly	Billie Joe Armstrong	Pop/Rock	2013-11-25 00:00:00	The Observer (UK)	71.0	While hardly a move into brave new musical pastures, it's not without charm and the use of a female voice puts just enough distance between this and the original.
No One's First, And You're Next	Modest Mouse	Indie	2009-08-04 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	75.0	Boring when they're not acting out, but too jarring when hitting their groove, Brock and company are forced to toe a finicky line between normalcy and absurdity.

Lookout Mountain, Lookout Sea	Silver Jews	Indie	2008-06-17 00:00:00	AllMusic	78.0	Lookout Mountain, Lookout Sea reveals more poetic, as well as playful, layers with each listen--and above all, underscores what an inviting songwriter Berman is, whether he's taking a darker or lighter approach.
After the Disco	Broken Bells	Pop/Rock	2014-02-04 00:00:00	The 405	71.0	After The Disco is an unashamedly brilliant pop album that might just be the right kind of stuff to get you through the remains of winter.
Black Messiah	D'Angelo	R&B;	2014-12-15 00:00:00	AllMusic	95.0	"The societal ruminations within the fiery judder of ""1000 Deaths,"" the dreamy churn of ""The Charade,"" and the falsetto blues of ""Till It's Done,"" fueled as much by current planetary ills and race relations as the same ones that prompted the works of D'Angelo's heroes, strike the deepest."
Th1rt3en	Megadeth	Pop/Rock	2011-11-01 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	71.0	Subtracting pretentious weight from a band that boasts several loose concept records in its catalog, TH1RT3EN might not don a full sense of humor, but it is 13 tracks of unadulterated hard rock in a classic package
The Avalanche: Outtakes & Extras From The Illinois Album	Sufjan Stevens	Indie	2006-07-11 00:00:00	The Guardian	76.0	Stevens is a pensively nostalgic folk chorister like the Paul Simon of Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme: he is just as prone to swerving into an epiphanic Bach-lite chorale, but as yet short of memorable tunes on his own account. He's close enough to be fascinating, though.
Let's Stay Friends	Les Savy Fav	Indie	2007-09-18 00:00:00	Uncut	87.0	It’s a welcome return, to say the least.
Obscurities	Stephin Merritt	Pop/Rock	2011-08-23 00:00:00	Uncut	74.0	"It only really comes alive with an alternate version of ""Take Ecstasy With Me,"" which reminds us that original Magnetic Fields singer Susan Anway is still his definitive interpreter, the Ella to his Cole. [Sep 2011, p.91]"
Provider	Bry Webb	Pop/Rock	2012-10-02 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	75.0	It's mostly just softly plucked, atmospheric guitar and Webb's weary vocals building up songs that are achingly slow, sombre and intimate.

So I'm hoping this review can offer an interesting perspective to this recently formed group & their debut album as someone without the biases or comparisons that would inevitably come with being a fan of the members' previous projects.  And I was very impressed by this album overall.  What we have here is 48 minutes of eccentric yet somewhat accessible indie rock.  It's characterized by tight precise drum grooves, guitar lines with a hint of reverb that can go from driving to emotional to chaotic in minutes, and expressive & passionate vocals with lyrics to match.  And it's all complimented with subtle electronics that help create an overall atmosphere for the album to live in, one that borders on soft but definitely has an edge to it.  Even though nearly every song here has a few potent hooks that'll stick in the back of your mind, for someone that wants a good accessible gateway to the more experimental stuff I'd look to the singles “Torn Maps” & “Turtle Neck”, which still have all the best elements of this album but do it in a bit more of a straightforward & catchy way, though the transition from the dream pop chorus & verses to the awesome distorted meltdown about halfway into Turtle Neck might throw some people off.  This is an interesting listen for sure, and I honestly can't think of a song here that I don't really like.  I feel like I haven't been listening to enough less-accessible stuff this year & this certainly helps with that.  It's nothing completely mind-blowing, but if you're looking for some great experimental indie rock, this is one of the first albums I'd recommend.Top 5 tracks: Turtle Neck, Torn Maps, I Cry for You, Mother Father Set Us Free, Morning SicknessScore: 90/100&hellip;Full Review &raquo;

This Delicate Thing We've Made	Darren Hayes	Rock	2007-08-21 00:00:00	LaneB.	61.0	"I will admit Darren Hayes happens to be my favourite music artist today by far, however I will not go so far as to mightily praise his soloI will admit Darren Hayes happens to be my favourite music artist today by far, however I will not go so far as to mightily praise his solo debut Spin - as it was rather... okay. Still, it is forgivable and understandable since the album was created to please his record company&#039;s taste, and Darren regrettably leashed in his creative juices. This being said, I do not believe I am being terribly biased when I whole heartily give this particular album 10 out of 10. And although many people believe the weak point of the album is over experimentation, I happen to think it&#039;s the main attraction - or should be. It&#039;s a refreshing change from the recycled garbage that&#039;s polluting our radios today. Finally something different, and critics&#039; first reaction is it&#039;s ""too much."" Although even the 3rd listen was somewhat overwhelming, it was always enjoyable. The variety of styles happen to be a bonus on this album - I promise you this, you won&#039;t get bored of this one quick. The theme of this album is Darren. Literally, the album is a gathering of all his experiences and emotions. Which makes for some pretty interesting music. His lyrics always possess a lot of substance, they will get you thinking and feeling. Other than that, concerning his writing abilities, I will say no more... since according to pretty much everyone(!), he is a lyrical genius. Now the happiest thing about this CD is attempting to ""genre-lize"" his material and having very little success at it. Music that&#039;s easily described is boring. It&#039;s aggravating to see little difference between artists today. Everyone (referring to mainstream music) is making music which has previously been proven successful by another. Darren is the exception. But here is my attempt at describing his music anyway (as vague as it may be). This Delicate thing we&#039;ve made is not fluffy pop. For those of you who have The Tension and The Spark, it truly is a continuation of that album, although it has evolved to a more upbeat and sanguine impression overall. It&#039;s a collaboration of 80&#039;s sounds and hard electronic beats, which Darren proves is the perfect marriage. Now here&#039;s the icing: his beautiful vocals. If this man cannot be appreciated for making new and intelligent music, can he at least be acknowledged for his voice? And lastly, each track is heavily laced with deep, genuine emotion. Since he&#039;s actually experienced the very emotions he sings about, you can hear the sincerity there. Something most artists lack perhaps because they don&#039;t write their own music. This album is a must for: Those who appreciate intelligent lyrics (written by the artist), beautiful vocals (also actually sung by the artist) and beats you&#039;ll be inclined to shake your bottom to... I guess in short, I could just rate this album &#039;E for everyone.&#039; Don&#039;t sue.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"
Warpaint	Warpaint	Pop/Rock	2014-01-21 00:00:00	PopMatters	74.0	This album is the first time that all of the band members have worked together on creating songs, and it makes a significant difference in their sound without disturbing the band’s core.
Again & Again	Thieves Like Us	Pop/Rock	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Pitchfork	57.0	A light but pervasive dusting of flanger effects and wavy-tuned synths makes the melodies sound cloudy and unfocused. Even the singles don't especially stand out.
Hard Candy	Madonna	Rock	2008-04-29 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	65.0	Even when she wrestles with Pharrell's abrupt stylistic changes or lets herself get absorbed in a Timberlake melody, Madonna still finds her way back on top.

RTJ2	Run the Jewels	Rap	2014-10-27 00:00:00	Fact Magazine (UK)	89.0	It’s the sheer energy on display that pushes Run The Jewels 2 through. The production is popping throughout, funky as hell, and often dotted with unexpected twists and turns.
Shall Noise Upon	Apollo Sunshine	Rock	2008-09-02 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	76.0	Their new album, Shall Noise Upon, is intellectually thinner, more musically pedantic, and not quite as tongue-in-cheek.

Ward turns in a star-studded set that feels at once a logical progression from 2006’s ""Post-War"" and a step closer to that all-out classic his preceding suggests; an assimilation and appropriation of American blues, gospel, country and folk as lovingly, winningly relayed as we’ve come to expect from the Portland-based troubadour."

No Elephants	Lisa Germano	Pop/Rock	2013-02-12 00:00:00	Blurt Magazine	68.0	More a series of half-drawn soundscapes than actual songs per se, No Elephants comes across as an exercise in the abstract, in which the artist makes almost no attempt to color inside the outlines.
You & I	Cut Off Your Hands	Indie	2009-01-20 00:00:00	AllMusic	61.0	You and I's stranger moments reveal that Cut Off Your Hands have more personality than the album's more tasteful songs suggest.
Reflektor	Arcade Fire	Pop/Rock	2013-10-29 00:00:00	Los Angeles Times	80.0	Genre jumping aside, it's the patterns as much as the riffs that are beguiling here.

Reanimation	Linkin Park	Rock	2002-07-30 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	60.0	On the one hand, the results are more varied than the monochromatic ''Hybrid Theory.'' On the other hand, the remixes at times obliterate one of the band's most distinctive characteristics -- the vocal interplay between singer Chester Bennington and MC Mike Shinoda, a blend that allows their pop tendencies to poke through from time to time.
The Holy Pictures	David Holmes	Rock	2008-09-08 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	79.0	It's a little less brazen, a little more personal but it fits together as a listen-start-to-finish endeavor as well if not better than any of his previous works and that is testament indeed.

Pocketful of Sunshine	Natasha Bedingfield	Rock	2008-01-22 00:00:00	Blender	65.0	Bedingfield’s second U.S. release sticks mostly to love odes and peppy self-help bromides, which occasionally veer close to Colbie Caillat’s lake of goop. It would be irksome if not for the uniformly strong pop and R&B; songcraft.

This must be someone who listens to too much Rap, or perhaps went to too many Hot Tuna (Electric band) concerts and has no eardrums.

Its airy guitar and straightforward rockWhile easily accessible and quite pleasant, this album is sincere in both content and form. Its airy guitar and straightforward rock instrumentation are complemented perfectly by Zahner-Isenberg's youthful, at times whimsical, vocals. This songwriter has an impressive knack for catchy melodies and face-value hooks, but simultaneously reveals maturity through contemplative chord structure and stylistic variety. The album successfully integrates various rock, folk, and pop influences. It may not be a game-changing or ground-breaking opus, but it should definitely not be overlooked. At very least, it is a great debut from a very promising songwriter.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Black and White	Wretch 32	Electronic	2011-08-30 00:00:00	The Independent on Sunday (UK)	70.0	"The beats aren't always the best, but Wretch, who lives on the notorious Tiverton Estate and whose ""mum's still living in the ends"", has a self-awareness lacking in many of his peers."
The Lady Killer	Cee Lo Green	Rap	2010-11-09 00:00:00	Los Angeles Times	80.0	For every swanky old-school touch, there's a glassy modernity that makes the album a sexy sonic adventure of loving and leaving.
By The Throat	Ben Frost	Electronic	2009-11-10 00:00:00	PopMatters	82.0	Certainly, this won’t be everyone’s cup of tea. But for those looking for mystical sources of inspiration, or an unsettling soundtrack, then By the Throat might be just the trick.
Maroon	Barenaked Ladies	Rock	2000-09-12 00:00:00	Q Magazine	59.0	En masse, Maroon's brisk acoustic rock settings and the hyperactive rush of words can still have you reaching for the skip button. But broken into bite-size chunks, its bitterly humorous dissection of the fumbling absurdities of modern life and death is not without pathos.

Maritime	Minotaur Shock	Electronic	2005-08-09 00:00:00	Pitchfork	76.0	When the Shock does muster a strong melody, he makes a synth-pop jam out of it, and those are Maritime's better moments.
Hollow Meadows	Richard Hawley	Pop/Rock	2015-09-11 00:00:00	Record Collector	78.0	So it’s an album that demands your attention.
Rainy Day Music	The Jayhawks	Rock	2003-04-08 00:00:00	Amazon.com	73.0	Even with its share of jangle-pop gems, the disc also offers a few bland strummers that never quite take off.
Sensuous	Cornelius	Indie	2007-04-24 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	70.0	It’s a little disjointed, more enigmatic, and more confounding than its predecessors: a gentle, mysterious giant of an album that could only have been created by a father.
The Devil You Know	Heaven & Hell	Rock	2009-04-28 00:00:00	Hartford Courant	63.0	Sure enough, we know these devils: they're the ones who make so many latter-day metal bands look like hopeless poseurs.

Singles 'Trick of the Light' and 'Backroads' start the album in more lively and upbeat vein before the more pounding and anthemic 'Islands', 'Deserter' and 'Dinosaurs' come in to add weight to the record. 'Untitled' adds space with an instrumental interlude before mid-tempo numbers 'Kings of the Mountain' and 'Victory Line' bring it back. 'Black Saucers' is the fastest and most aggressive song on here but is perfectly placed so that it doesn't feel out of place. But the true closing trio ('Outro' being in much the same vein as 'Untitled' and 'Intro') of 'The Blue, The Green', 'The Day's War' and 'Call of Horses' give this album the send off it deserves with the right mix of soul searching beauty, space and huge sound that makes this album so great.Best tracks: The Blue, The Green; Victory LineFor fans of: Biffy Clyro, Mallory Knox&hellip;Full Review &raquo;

In The Vines	Castanets	Indie	2007-10-23 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	75.0	If In the Vines isn't a record that impresses at the level of individual songs, neither is it something you throw on in the background and forget about.

Minimum Rock N Roll	Chain & the Gang	Pop/Rock	2014-04-14 00:00:00	Exclaim	70.0	Minimum Rock N Roll is a dynamic and vibrant good-time screed; it's not anti-consumption but it is out to have people consume discerningly.

The Harsh Light of Day	Fastball	Rock	2000-09-19 00:00:00	CDNow	64.0	With its brand of easily accessible pop rock, the Austin, Texas-based trio presents an extremely likable musical front that's based more upon influence than innovation.
Shadows in the Night	Bob Dylan	Pop/Rock	2015-02-03 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	82.0	The songs chosen are elegiac, and Dylan balances out any hints of winking self-awareness by freighting his new compositions with a heavy air of wistful sadness.

Presents...Here Come the Bombs	Gaz Coombes	Pop/Rock	2012-05-21 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	70.0	Ultimately the riffs and hooks aren't up to the standard of previous Coombes-led outings, and whilst the textured soundscapes can help disguise this slightly the reality is that the majority of this record, whilst occasionally interesting and certainly surprising, is just ... a little boring.
Into The Blue Again	The Album Leaf	Indie	2006-09-12 00:00:00	Playlouder	67.0	A lesson in understatement, 'Into The Blue Again' reminds us that LaValle is the undisputed master of emitting emotion without embellishing it with perverse orchestration or all manner of multi-tracked trickery.
Reptile	Eric Clapton	Rock	2001-03-13 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	66.0	Over the course of fourteen tracks, Clapton blends virtually every style he's worked in during the past thirty-five years. Whether it will strike your ears as something-for-everyone generosity or a patchy jumble probably depends on how much of a purist you are.

Actor	St. Vincent	Indie	2009-05-05 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	81.0	Here, Clark’s lyrics are less overtly clever than on her debut, and they’re more deeply buried in layers of her spastic instrumentation. Nonetheless, they suggest a subtle, abstract intelligence.
Distortion	Magnetic Fields	Indie	2008-01-15 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	79.0	Distortion is above cynical reproach--effortlessly modern and definitively 2008, yet flitting with the ghosts of Shields, Madder Rose (ask your 90s alt.indie expert uncle) and The Jesus And Mary Chain.
IRM	Charlotte Gainsbourg	Rock	2010-01-26 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	80.0	As a pairing between two artists, the album works, though not nearly as much as it could have if both were at the top of their game.
Devil's Music	Teddybears	Pop/Rock	2011-07-05 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	62.0	It isn't life music, unless you live in a camp permutation of Gold's Gym. The Air-like, Gary Numan-lite instrumentals popping up between the songs with hit potential are way lighter than air. I don't mind 'em, but also don't love 'em.
The Meadowlands	The Wrens	Indie	2003-09-09 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	85.0	With about twenty killer lines or couplets per song, unexpected hooks coming from everywhere and one of the most ingenious track sequences of the year, it’s not really so hard to imagine what The Wrens have been doing all this time.

Amnesiac	Radiohead	Rock	2001-06-05 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	75.0	Despite Thom Yorke's assertions that 'Amnesiac' stands alone, it complements 'Kid A' so beautifully, develops it with such conviction, that the idea Radiohead ever cut themselves off to spite their fans suddenly seems irredeemably churlish.
Insignificance	Jim O'Rourke	Indie	2001-11-20 00:00:00	Nude As The News	81.0	Insignificance&#146;s length of less than 40 minutes perhaps indicates that O&#146;Rourke is not as serious about producing a pop opus as he is interested in getting a kick out of screwing around with pop song writing.

Made of Bricks	Kate Nash	Rock	2008-01-08 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	71.0	Essentially, Made Of Bricks is comprised of a lot of below-par b-sides, three pretty special tracks and then bunch of 'nice tries'...but don't expect anyone to be whistling them in three months' time.
Peter Gabriel Tribute Album: And I'll Scratch Yours	Various Artists	Pop/Rock	2014-01-07 00:00:00	Clash Music	63.0	The result is a slightly odd, somewhat disjointed response, and one that serves to highlight just how daunting it is to tackle a cover from the former Genesis frontman’s catalogue.

B4.DA.$$	Joey Bada$$	Rap	2015-01-20 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	74.0	Bada$$ may not have Lamar's gift for lyricism or narrative, but his work is impressively composed for such a young voice, stringing together intricate series of metaphors over crisp, non-intrusive old-school beats.
Inches	Les Savy Fav	Indie	2004-04-20 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	84.0	Defeatist it may be, but such genius is very rarely recognised in a band&#146;s lifetime. So be it &#150; because there genuinely is no verbal persuasion that could exceed a single listen to America&#146;s most underrated.
Under And Under	Blank Dogs	Indie	2009-05-26 00:00:00	PopMatters	71.0	Under and Under is more often than not a good trick, catchy and insistent, but a nagging question remains: Is Sniper saying anything? Literally, of course, he is, but it’s nearly impossible to decipher.
Sleeper	Carmen Villain	Pop/Rock	2013-03-12 00:00:00	AllMusic	78.0	An exciting debut, Sleeper is a rawer, deeper album than might have been expected, full of music that's more daring and more rewarding than the work of many artists without the baggage attached to Villain's background.

Skin Of Evil	Blackout Beach	Indie	2009-01-20 00:00:00	Pitchfork	64.0	Mercer's able to fill cavern-like spaces with the might of his many soliloquies.

Attention Please	Boris	Pop/Rock	2011-05-24 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	72.0	Unlike previous output, the ten tracks on Attention Please are slick, synthesized, almost club-ready vamps (or at least that seems to be their aspiration). The affect may be intentional but for the most part I found them to be drowsy, forgettable, head-nodding throwaways with at least a passable amount of textural variety but very little in the way of memorable song-writing.

It’s also clear, however, that they’ve got good taste and a promising decorating plan.

What Will We Be	Devendra Banhart	Folk	2009-10-27 00:00:00	The Boston Phoenix	69.0	Even when Banhart seems more in a predicament than in the zone, he’s hopelessly inventive. Several songs experience complete transformations over their modest three-minute spans, succeeding like little daybreaks.
Fragile Future	Hawthorne Heights	Rock	2008-08-05 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	61.0	It's somewhat disappointing, that the disc's sound and content hew so closely to the standard emo/screamo/hardcore formula. [8 Aug 2008, p.68]
Receivers	Parts & Labor	Indie	2008-10-21 00:00:00	Magnet	78.0	While Parts & Labor’s grinding wall of noise seems to invite this kind of egalitarianism, the experiment never seems gimmicky or extraneous. Instead, it becomes virtually impossible to distinguish what sounds do or do not belong. It all comes together in one glorious racket.
Rated O	Oneida	Indie	2009-07-07 00:00:00	The Guardian	73.0	Oneida's show-your-working approach undoubtedly justi?es judicious use of the skip button, but the best bits of Rated O are well worth digging for.
The Isness	The Future Sound of London	Rock	2002-08-13 00:00:00	Uncut	62.0	What continually redeems this acid flashback to a more well-meaning era is its endlessly metamorphosing soundscape, its kaleidoscope washes of virtual psychedelia. [Oct 2002, p.101]
Sainthood	Tegan and Sara	Rock	2009-10-27 00:00:00	Boston Globe	78.0	This is a set of power pop with hooky choruses and chiming harmonies to go along with splashes of synths mixed in for throwback '80s flavor (especially 'Red Belt'). It makes for a 40-minute blast of smart songcraft.

Nonetheless, this impressive debut isEnglish electronic musician SOHN may not be instantly making a large name for himself with Tremors. Nonetheless, this impressive debut is delightfully refreshing, comfortably accessible, and irrefutably unique at a time in the year where music isn’t really knocking us off our feet. Tremors is brimming with fresh and innovative sounds and compositions, tied together with a consistent aesthetic theme that allows the album to always flow coherently. However, despite possessing many complex and clever arrangements and layers, Tremors doesn’t always come across as dynamic as one would hope. SOHN, in his meticulousness regarding energy and atmosphere, casually ignores melody and structure at times, resulting in a very pleasant but easily forgettable experience. So while you may enjoy listening to the album in the car ride home, don’t expect to find yourself still moving to the album’s rhythm and lip-syncing the lyrics an hour later (save for a couple of standout tracks). In the long run, Tremors never surpasses amazing, but it gets pretty darn close most of the time. I hope to see SOHN producing some exciting hits in the coming years.FINAL SCORE: 85 (great ----------o---------- almost perfect)&hellip;Full Review &raquo;

In Godhead's case, all of that terrain is covered in just the album's opening track, the NIN-meets-New Order new wave rocker ""The Reckoning."""
Restless	Xzibit	Rap	2000-12-12 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	75.0	Restless isn't quite the metatextual running commentary on fame and persecution that The Marshall Mathers LP is, but, like Eminem, Xzibit has gone from addressing the dire circumstances that created him to focusing squarely on life as a rap star.... A weak patch roughly halfway in slows it down, but Restless accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do: It consolidates Xzibit's new fan base while retaining enough classic flavor to avoid alienating Likwit Crew diehards.

Wincing The Night Away	The Shins	Indie	2007-01-23 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	79.0	For every elastic, tuneful, vacuum-packed “Phantom Limb” or “Australia” -- pop craftsmanship of the highest order, redolent of Chutes’ front-to-back triumph, crystalline, flawless and packed so thick with thoughts and words and hooks that they unravel marvelously indefinitely -- there’s an obvious b-side.
Love Songs for Robots	Patrick Watson	Pop/Rock	2015-05-12 00:00:00	Mojo	76.0	On In Circles, with its plangent, Yan Tiersen-style piano, something wonderful happens--a feeling of limitlessness opening up. [Jun 2015, p.89]

The Fool	Ryn Weaver	Pop/Rock	2015-06-16 00:00:00	Under The Radar	65.0	The Fool contains many songs in line behind that first single; put any one of them on at random and you'll think it's a pretty great pop song. Play them in order though, for 40 minutes, and the experience becomes repetitive and empty.
Golden Age	Grandchildren	Pop/Rock	2013-05-07 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	68.0	The replay value requires a couple of things: some sort of ear for harmony, and the utmost confidence that the feeling will remain universal, even when the sounds are not. Golden Age almost never forgets to bring both.

DS2	Future	Rap	2015-07-17 00:00:00	AllMusic	81.0	"With the release of the album DS2--Dirty Sprite 2, named after his hit mixtape -- he becomes a hip-hop version of Lee ""Scratch"" Perry, a strange and yet in command figure standing at the center of a slick, inventive swirl of music."
End It All	Beans	Rap	2011-02-15 00:00:00	Uncut	68.0	The problem here is Beans himself, whose verbosity too often resembles a limerick writer who tries to cram, as many syllables into the last line as he possibly can. [Mar 2011, p.83]

Lights Out	Ingrid Michaelson	Pop/Rock	2014-04-15 00:00:00	AllMusic	74.0	Lights Out features a broadened sonic palette and a much more robust vocal performance; it's a transformation she's been perfecting since 2009's Everybody and 2012's Human Again.
If Not Now, When?	Incubus	Pop/Rock	2011-07-12 00:00:00	Rock Sound	48.0	Overall, If Not Now, When? is the sound of Incubus coming of age. It's not particularly experimental nor is it completely straightforward but it is concise and a risk that's paid off.

Nightmare Ending	Eluvium	Electronic	2013-05-14 00:00:00	Spin	81.0	Nightmare Ending may not be Cooper's most cohesive record, but it's a perfect representation of the indie-rock generation's most diverse ambient musician.
Lost In Space	Aimee Mann	Indie	2002-08-27 00:00:00	Neumu.net	74.0	This is a rare record that simply responds to the quiet masses who maybe feel just a bit to much too often, and offers them a soothing, downbeat source of comfort without preaching or apology.

Ride Out	Bob Seger	Pop/Rock	2014-10-14 00:00:00	AllMusic	69.0	While there's some charm in the fact that Seger is loose enough to keep his ends untied, Ride Out is hobbled by that exacting production: conceptually, it's something of a ragged mess and it'd benefit from sounding like one.
Party Store	The Dirtbombs	Pop/Rock	2011-02-01 00:00:00	The Guardian	70.0	The highlights--versions of Inner City's Good Life, Rhythim Is Rhythim's Strings of Life, Jaguar by Underground Resistance--don't sound much like techno any more, but have enough suppleness and propulsive thrust that it is possible to imagine a dancefloor heaving to them.
Ancestral Star	Barn Owl	Pop/Rock	2010-11-01 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	77.0	Having demonstrated their ability to adeptly blend movement and atmospheric melody, Caminiti and Porras should aim higher than simple--albeit skillful--drones. That said, Ancestral Star delivers more than enough to reward the patient listener.

Spanish Moss & Total Loss	Shout Out Out Out Out	Electronic	2012-07-17 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	65.0	This is fairly arm's-length music--more about beat and texture than emotional confessionals.
Lucky	Nada Surf	Indie	2008-02-05 00:00:00	The New York Times	77.0	While Nada Surf is only a trio, in the studio it stacks up guitars and vocals, multiplying Mr. Caws’s thin voice into a dreamy or determined chorale.
Ruler of the Night	Magic Trick	Pop/Rock	2012-06-12 00:00:00	Pitchfork	75.0	Fewer generalities and a more interesting narrative would have gone a long way: For all the sharp, intriguing musical experimentation, the lyrics are too easy to forget.
Eyehategod	Eyehategod	Pop/Rock	2014-05-27 00:00:00	PopMatters	77.0	There aren’t any real surprises at work on Eyehategod, and that’s just fine. Its relatively simple approach of no frills instrumentals meets raw, demented vocals feels surprisingly fresh in its earnestness.
Blood From A Stone	Hanne Hukkelberg	Indie	2009-05-12 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	66.0	Although those searching for a raised pulse will find the title all too appropriate, Blood From A Stone’s hushed, held-breath, Cocteau Twins-ish atmosphere is addictive.

MM..Food	MF Doom	Indie	2004-11-16 00:00:00	RapReviews.com	81.0	He traverses the well-trodden avenues of gun and drug rap, reinterpreting redundant rhetoric into remarkable displays of comic genius, all while sticking firmly to a food motif.
Transistor Rhythm	Addison Groove	Electronic	2012-04-02 00:00:00	Q Magazine	70.0	While the grooves here prove to be equally minimal [to Headhunter], his debut LP is driven by a febrile, wildstyle energy at odds with dubstep's cavernous soundscapes. [May 2012, p.90]
Everyday	Dave Matthews Band	Rock	2001-02-27 00:00:00	CDNow	67.0	But the Dave Matthews Band retains one essential ingredient that transcends Everyday's calculated pop: Dave Matthews.

The  Civil Wars	The Civil Wars	Folk	2013-08-06 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	71.0	Ultimately, The Civil Wars plays out lyrically insipid and completely oblivious to the fact that their vocals strive for meaningful but define overbearing.

Emoh	Lou Barlow	Indie	2005-01-25 00:00:00	Alternative Press	63.0	As singer-songwriters go, Barlow's not worthy to make a Starbucks run for Conor Oberst, Jim White, Joseph Arthur or Chris Carrabba. [Mar 2005, p.122]
The  Argument	Grant Hart	Pop/Rock	2013-07-23 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	80.0	Considering the breadth and depth of his work with Hüsker Dü, Hart doesn’t need to secure his legacy; that’s already been done. But with The Argument, he’s substantially and staggeringly added to it.
The Hungry Saw	Tindersticks	Indie	2008-09-16 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	79.0	The one slight that could be pinned on the The Hungry Saw is that there’s very little here that couldn’t slot seamlessly into any of the group’s output over the last 16 years.

Human Conditions	Richard Ashcroft	Rock	2003-02-25 00:00:00	E! Online	61.0	Human Conditions is as bloated and directionless as its awkward title suggests, weighted with meandering songs without melodies, lyrics straight out of freshman-year philosophy class and a sickly slick sheen.

Hesitation Marks	Nine Inch Nails	Pop/Rock	2013-09-03 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	77.0	Tense, electronic, impeccably crafted and, yes, a little bit too long (classic 90s alt-rock), it’s a satisfying twist on the band’s legacy that doesn’t abandon its signature sound.

In Our Nature	Jose Gonzalez	Indie	2007-09-25 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	72.0	It's true that most of the attention Gonzalez received in the beginning was from songs other artists' wrote. The difference with Gonzalez is that he picks songs that fit his minimalist and whimsical approach--and he often makes them better than the originals.
Chills on Glass	Dead Rider	Pop/Rock	2014-03-18 00:00:00	Blurt Magazine	78.0	Chills on Glass may be rock viewed sideways, through a cracked mirror, after 48 hours without sleep, but it is till the recognizable thing.

Rock N Roll Jesus	Kid Rock	Rock	2007-10-09 00:00:00	AllMusic	62.0	The music isn't as serious: splashy and silly though it may be, at least it gets the basic sound right, even if it's way too polished and precise.

Destruction in Yr Soul	Hospital Ships	Pop/Rock	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Blurt Magazine	63.0	In isolation, he finds beautiful music; with a band, he discovered confusion, pretentiousness and ultimately an average record.
Street Songs of Love	Alejandro Escovedo	Pop/Rock	2010-06-29 00:00:00	The Guardian	76.0	Backing band the Sensitive Boys provide some ear-catching guitar tweaks to upbeat numbers Silver Cloud and This Bed Is Getting Crowded, but the pace slows halfway through, at which point it gets hard to beat the feeling that Street Songs is decent, assured and confident, but pretty unexceptional.
Beyond the Lightless Sky	Hull	Pop/Rock	2011-10-11 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	70.0	"Lightless Sky's monochromatic metal erosion could use a tonal infusion, but the vocal excoriation of ""False Priest"" testifies these brutal ruins."
The Flying Club Cup	Beirut	Rock	2007-10-09 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	80.0	"Despite being the unmistakable sound of Beirut, this is not the ""Orkestar"" extension so widely expected. Rather than congesting the listener with frantic Eastern European folk shanties, a poignant nobility and romantic notion of contemporary France permeates its way into your conscience with unbridled zeal."
Adam Green & Binki Shapiro	Adam Green	Folk	2013-01-29 00:00:00	Uncut	67.0	For the most part, Green and Shapiro come over like a couple working their troubles in group therapy through gritted teeth. [Feb 2013, p.73]
Pop Ambient 2014	Various Artists	Electronic	2014-02-04 00:00:00	The 405	74.0	Not outstaying its welcome (a common problem for samplers that peddle transcendent music which can occasionally feel like it is treading water), there is a good diversity of experiments, albeit largely backed by familiar themes.
Another Day On Earth	Brian Eno	Indie	2005-06-14 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	71.0	Another Day is nowhere near as invested with ideas as Eno's name-making work, but its easy pleasures still rub and float away.
Not Animal	Margot & the Nuclear So and So's	Indie	2008-10-07 00:00:00	AllMusic	66.0	Not Animal gets better as it progresses--the sparser, melancholic songs are pushed to the front, leaving the band's energetic material to bring up the rear--and Margot's sophomore album subsequently concludes on a high note, effectively masking any sour taste left by the band's battle with Epic Records.
Perfect Darkness	Fink	Electronic	2011-07-19 00:00:00	BBC Music	69.0	Perfect Darkness is rather special.
The  Stepkids	The Stepkids	R&B;	2011-09-27 00:00:00	AllMusic	74.0	Everything's easy and natural, and the Stepkids sound more like purveyors of the genre than imitators. Quite an accomplishment.
DJ-Kicks	John Talabot	Electronic	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Spin	77.0	It isn't just a celebration of the warm-up DJ; it's a self-portrait of an artist who wouldn't be who he is today without once having had all those empty rooms to fill.
The Earth Is Not A Cold Dead Place	Explosions in the Sky	Indie	2003-11-04 00:00:00	The Guardian	86.0	These are tunes that twinkle and thunder like exploding stars, and show that there are still infinite possibilities in two guitars, bass and drums.
Sound & Color	Alabama Shakes	Pop/Rock	2015-04-21 00:00:00	American Songwriter	80.0	Sometimes the rhythms skitter and stutter; sometimes they throb, or soothe. More often than anything, they surprise and intrigue.

Scars & Stories	The Fray	Pop/Rock	2012-02-07 00:00:00	Absolute Punk (Staff reviews)	56.0	While they don't throw any curveballs or stir the pot too much, the band definitely stays true to their core, crafting yet another memorable piano pop-rock record with these stories.

Silver Lining	Bonnie Raitt	Rock	2002-04-09 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	74.0	Raitt can still shake some action, but ''Silver Lining'' makes you wish she'd shake it up a bit more.
Keep It Like A Secret	Built To Spill	Indie	1999-02-23 00:00:00	Pitchfork	79.0	Recalls last year's fine Halo Benders release, The Rebels Not In, the album Martsch recorded with Beat Happening's Calvin Johnson and former Spinanes and current Built to Spill drummer Scott Plouf.

Private Suit	Bettie Serveert	Indie	2000-09-05 00:00:00	Wall of Sound	80.0	"Not only does every song here work beautifully on its own, but the recording listens cohesively front to back, from the frosty chime of ""Unsound"" to the enchanting blues of the closing ""Healer."""
Field Songs	William Elliott Whitmore	Pop/Rock	2011-07-12 00:00:00	PopMatters	83.0	We Iowans may not be family farmers anymore, but we'd still like to think we share their values and that these are true American ideals. Whitmore connects us to that in an inspiring and stimulating way.
Chain Gang Of Love	The Raveonettes	Indie	2003-09-02 00:00:00	Julia	77.0	"While this album may drag on, it still has the sparkle of originality glossing over its banal charm. This is its saving grace.

Brassbound	The Ordinary Boys	Indie	2005-06-20 00:00:00	Uncut	50.0	A band slowly escaping the weight of their still-obvious influences. [Aug 2005, p.104]
...And Then We Saw Land	Tunng	Rock	2010-04-06 00:00:00	Absolute Punk (Staff reviews)	74.0	Now the experimentation with electric guitars, even more electronic sampling and a focus on vocalist Becky Jacobs has brought Tunng to a paradise of exceeded expectations.

Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty	Big Boi	Rap	2010-07-06 00:00:00	Dot Music	90.0	It's eclectic, electrifying, eccentric and more than a little bit ludicrous, but Sir Lucious's ambition is as infectious as its madness is dazzling.

Radium Death	William Elliott Whitmore	Pop/Rock	2015-03-31 00:00:00	Blurt Magazine	65.0	As evidenced by the rabid tones of Radium Death, his eighth album and perhaps his most demonstrative, Whitmore is both resolute and resilient.
Drenge	Drenge	Pop/Rock	2013-08-19 00:00:00	The Line of Best Fit	76.0	There’s heaps of incendiary six-stringers, throttling beats and barbed tongues; it’s a potent brew that they peddle, but one that suits them just fine.
Raditude	Weezer	Rock	2009-11-03 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	57.0	His willingness to make fun of his psychosexual damage only makes it more poignant.
Wait 'Til Night	Cooly G	Electronic	2014-10-21 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	66.0	The album is full of familiar tropes dressed up in gold and leather, and the songs are wrapped in a plastic that stops our touch--turns it cold, numb from feeling the electricity of the body, of the night.
Eska	Eska	Pop/Rock	2015-04-27 00:00:00	The 405	82.0	Unwrapping the record reveals a collection of tightly packed delights; exceptional songs that grandstand the artist's lyrical prowess, outstanding musicianship and incredibly flexible voice, readily guided by Herbert (Bjork, Michachu, Roisin Murphy) in the producer's chair.
Closer to the Truth	Cher	Electronic	2013-09-24 00:00:00	Boston Globe	61.0	While Closer to the Truth is smartly frontloaded with a heap of glossy South Beach bangers--including the fiery, heavenly heave of “Take It Like a Man,” the noir throb of “Dressed to Kill,” and “Red,” which hits you like a rum punch to the face--the second wind of her 26th album, presumably designed for the drive home from the club, seems to insist she’s more than a remix ingredient or Auto-tune fodder.

The Greatest	Cat Power	Indie	2006-01-24 00:00:00	ShakingThrough.net	80.0	Despite losing creative momentum down the stretch, it’s still a remarkably affecting and mature record, proof that Chan Marshall kicks off the second act of her career in top form.
Singles	Future Islands	Pop/Rock	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Exclaim	82.0	It's rare to find an album this coherent and firm in quality. But best of all, a good half of the record will give you plenty of inspiration to channel Herring's sweet dance moves.
Ghetto Classics	Jaheim	R&B;	2006-02-14 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	67.0	By the time the saccharine last track rolls around, you feel like you've heard that same unremarkable melody, midtempo shuffle, and 1970s soul-sampling style on repeat for nearly an hour. [17 Feb 2006, p.76]

FFS	FFS	Pop/Rock	2015-06-09 00:00:00	Boston Globe	78.0	FFS is more than worth the wait: a stylish, outsized romp that balances Franz Ferdinand’s gentlemanly muscle with Sparks’s adoration for the theatrical.
I Remember Me	Jennifer Hudson	R&B;	2011-03-22 00:00:00	Los Angeles Times	68.0	Hudson has a big, warm, church-trained R&B; diva voice, a sure instrument for belting the blues and affirming the spirit. But that voice has never seemed comfortable among the bright shiny toys of a pop studio.
The First Days Of Spring	Noah and the Whale	Rock	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Filter	71.0	The First Days of Spring falls in the gentle, folky space between Belle & Sebastian and It’s Jo and Danny, but manages to carve out a singular place for itself with thoughtful lyricism and artful songwriting.
Iradelphic	Clark	Electronic	2012-04-03 00:00:00	Clash Music	67.0	This is an album self-assured in its odd-ball-ness, yet confident enough to step out into territories typically less habitual to it's maker.
Drums And Guns	Low	Indie	2007-03-20 00:00:00	Uncut	81.0	They may have defined a genre, but Low can clearly still move forward. [May 2007, p.99]

Soul Journey	Gillian Welch	Country	2003-06-03 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	78.0	Soul Journey finds her and collaborator David Rawlings making subtly searing front-porch folk-country, often sparing the embellishments for songs that are by turns raw, spare, direct, and achingly pretty.
Sky Blue Sky	Wilco	Indie	2007-05-15 00:00:00	Boston Globe	73.0	Wilco hasn't forsaken its experimental streak, and the group uses it in the service of darkness -- or rather the threat of darkness.
Year of the Hare [EP]	Fucked Up	Pop/Rock	2015-06-16 00:00:00	AllMusic	70.0	Year of the Hare is best recommended to fans who already have a grasp of Fucked Up's more esoteric moments--beginners should try 2011's David Comes to Life or 2014's Glass Boys--but this is still smart, lively, and thoroughly individual music from one of the most free-thinking bands to emerge from the punk rock underground.

Pop/Rock	2011-11-15 00:00:00	AllMusic	87.0	The benefit of a comp is that it's totally possible, even welcome, to downplay dull lapses like Around the Sun--and, when combined with well-chosen highlights from the band's powerful first two acts, adds up to a thorough narrative of R.E.M.'s entire career.
Kairos	White Hinterland	Rock	2010-03-09 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	76.0	"Equally, those who delighted in unravelling [""Phylactery Factory""]knotty, brilliant album will emerge dazed and blinking into the wide spaces and sweet melodies of Kairos."
Fears Trending	The Phantom Band	Pop/Rock	2015-01-26 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	76.0	The only constant is the deep, mellow drum tone that brings the band’s disparities together and creates a beautifully cohesive narrative flow.

Until The Earth Begins To Part	Broken Records	Indie	2009-07-07 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	64.0	We have an album that displays a band with considerable potential, but which is disappointingly lacking in imagination: compositionally and lyrically.
Pom Pom	Ariel Pink	Pop/Rock	2014-11-17 00:00:00	Alternative Press	75.0	Your best bet is to just let go and enjoy this long, schizophrenic ride through his candy-colored, drug-addled musical subconscious. [Dec 2014, p.107]
Street Sweeper Social Club	Street Sweeper Social Club	Rock	2009-06-16 00:00:00	Urb	56.0	The true brilliance here is what is not done rather than what is. Instead of getting repetitive, drawn out, and maybe even boring, the album concludes itself at a measly yet perfect 11 tracks, clocking in at just under 40 minutes.
The Minus 5 [The Gun Album]	The Minus 5	Indie	2006-02-07 00:00:00	Lost At Sea	75.0	Their songs aren’t radio friendly nor are they mind-blowing in scope or execution, but give them time and they’ll creep into the rotating playlist in your head.
Tyranny	Julian Casablancas & the Voidz	Pop/Rock	2014-09-23 00:00:00	Mojo	66.0	For all its ambitious and admirable wilfulness, the sound of Casablancas playing in his sandpit is still an acquired taste. [Nov 2014, p.94]
Negativity	Deer Tick	Country	2013-09-24 00:00:00	AllMusic	72.0	Though Negativity bounces around a little, its tormented core and multifaceted musical approach make it one of Deer Tick's most consistent and enjoyable albums.
band red	KaitO	Indie	2003-05-20 00:00:00	Neumu.net	82.0	Band Red spins bouncy, raw, sloppy and slightly erratic punk that can stake a claim for carving out a jagged edge of its own, complete with loveable, contagious sing-along sounds.
Making Mirrors	Gotye	Electronic	2012-01-31 00:00:00	The Observer (UK)	69.0	Sadly, this album has as many misses as hits.
'64 - '95	Lemon Jelly	Electronic	2005-01-25 00:00:00	Dot Music	72.0	Despite the wide range of musical styles used here, each one is absorbed into that unique Jellies sound, smoothed and polished almost beyond recognition into a sumptuous, unthreatening ambient groove with echoes of The Orb, Groove Armada and Zero 7.
Atlantis: Hymns For Disco	k-os	Indie	2007-02-20 00:00:00	Pitchfork	70.0	Atlantis strives for a patchwork cohesiveness, with equal parts neo-soul, reggae, rap, and rock, bound by a vaguely spiritual message and partially elaborated water-related extended metaphor.
Last Days of Meaning	Nitin Sawhney	Electronic	2011-09-27 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	61.0	While not as flawed and over-ambitious as London Undersound or Human, the feeling persists that this is an artist who would benefit from calling a halt to all the grand projects for a while and going back to basics.
Trust Me	Craig David	R&B;	2008-05-06 00:00:00	Mojo	53.0	All the ingredients for another hit album are here. The only thing missing is soul. [Dec 2007, p.110]
Mechanical Bull	Kings of Leon	Pop/Rock	2013-09-24 00:00:00	American Songwriter	70.0	By design, Mechanical Bull was made for fun, and in that spirit, they succeeded.
Fever Ray	Fever Ray	Electronic	2009-03-24 00:00:00	Pitchfork	81.0	The album moves at roughly the same pace and with the same general tone, rendering some of the songs indistinguishable at first, but committed listens will reveal this to be as nuanced and as rich of a production as anything either Dreijer has done.
Under Construction	Missy Elliott	Dance	2002-11-12 00:00:00	BWETMatangi	81.0	"Everybody loves Missy, but this is her worst work. ""Work It"" is the summer anthem of the album, and that's the high point. But Missy is very talented."
Desperate Ground	The Thermals	Pop/Rock	2013-04-16 00:00:00	Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM)	73.0	While the fury remains, there a perceptible dip in quality in nearly every aspect of the Thermals’ formula.

If you listen to this album for what it is, without any preconceived notions, I think you'll enjoy it. If you go in expecting Siamese Dream Part 2, you're not going to like it as much. Billy's not at that stage of his life anymore, and what you hear on this album is a much more mature Billy, and as such, a much more mature Smashing Pumpkins album. I would've preferred some longer songs on here, but for what it is, it's very good.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Any Port in a Storm	Scott and Charlene's Wedding	Pop/Rock	2013-07-23 00:00:00	The Guardian	71.0	A stolid lack of poetry combined with Dermody's flat intonation could make Any Port in a Storm hard-going, were it not for his evident, dogged attempt to be Jonathan Richman fronting the Stooges, and a stoic faith in the goodness of life and the value of human endeavour that brims with hope.
Zoetrope	King of the Mountains	Electronic	2014-04-29 00:00:00	The 405	67.0	The best place to file Zoetrope would probably be on the shelf marked 'albums worth a punt if you have a few bob spare'.
It's All Around You	Tortoise	Indie	2004-04-06 00:00:00	Filter	68.0	A choice specimen of audio sophisitication. [#9, p.106]
Second Hand Heart	Dwight Yoakam	Country	2015-04-14 00:00:00	Spin	84.0	Second Hand Heart is a whisker less awesome, but in the last month only Earl Sweatshirt’s album could match its acerbic brevity.

Ghostory	School of Seven Bells	Pop/Rock	2012-02-28 00:00:00	Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM)	69.0	With Ghostory, School of Seven Bells recovers with a newfound voice, still evokes everything they once were as dream pop dealers, but it's still extremely visible that they have more room to grow.
Hokey Fright	The Uncluded	Rap	2013-05-07 00:00:00	AllMusic	79.0	Expect the expected with plenty of xylophones, campfire guitars, and Dawson's breathy cuteness mixing with Aesop's serious severity, but expect to be thrown as well, mostly by ideas of community and how strangers can leave lifelong impressions.
Megafaun	Megafaun	Pop/Rock	2011-09-20 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	83.0	Megafaun is as distinctive as its predecessors, showing a prettier, more approachable side to a band that appears to be constantly evolving.
Cardiology	Good Charlotte	Pop/Rock	2010-11-02 00:00:00	Rock Sound	50.0	Commercially-driven producers or not, though, the band have a knack for keeping their sound current and contemporary –- while still being reminiscent of their early material.
Burn Your Fire for No Witness	Angel Olsen	Pop/Rock	2014-02-18 00:00:00	Under The Radar	84.0	She still sings prettily, and can prove it when doubted, but Olsen is more than willing to ugly it up so her songs can speak for themselves. [Feb/Mar 2014, p.74]
Flow	Foetus	Rock	2001-05-08 00:00:00	Splendid	81.0	"The downside here will be fairly obvious to anyone familiar with Thirlwell's previous output. While Flow's integration of big band jazz and other ""external"" musical styles is some of Thirlwell's most accomplished work to date -- creditable not only to better technology, but to the growth of his already respectable skills as a conventional composer -- its thematic elements remain the same."
Led Zeppelin II [Remastered]	Led Zeppelin	Rock	2014-06-03 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	95.0	Led Zeppelin II binds the biggest and baddest of the group's heavyweight first chapter with the thinest of extras, 33 minutes of early mixes and backing tracks.
Cobra Juicy	Black Moth Super Rainbow	Pop/Rock	2012-10-23 00:00:00	Pitchfork	72.0	This might be BMSR's most accessible effort, but if you couldn't get past the vocoder and voodoo before, it's unlikely that you will now.
Heligoland	Massive Attack	Electronic	2010-02-09 00:00:00	XLR8r	72.0	The album's dusty beats, pointed electronics, and cinematic feel are pleasantly familiar, at best they recall the band's past glory rather than pushing forward their legacy.
Sweet Disarray	Dan Croll	Pop/Rock	2014-04-01 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	59.0	For someone who records under his own name and not that of a collective, Croll remains a mystery, a patchwork of influences content to blend in, not to stand out.
Chelsea Light Moving	Chelsea Light Moving	Pop/Rock	2013-03-05 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	76.0	"Closing with the SST stomp of ""Lips,"" summery strumming ""Frank O'Hara Hit,"" and the smudged punk of ""Communist Eyes,"" CLM never amounts to a full state of the union. Settle instead for a New York state of mind."
III: Beneath Trident's Tomb	Twilight	Pop/Rock	2014-03-18 00:00:00	Pitchfork	65.0	Most of these songs suffer from a lack of motion or a mere inability to edit the excess away from that motion.
Street's Disciple	Nas	Rap	2004-11-30 00:00:00	The Guardian	80.0	Although Nasir Jones can't match arch-enemy Jay-Z's commercial firepower, he has accomplished one thing even Beyonc&#233;'s beau couldn't: a persuasive double album.
Man Vs Machine	Xzibit	Rap	2002-10-01 00:00:00	Blender	59.0	Much of the material features clamorous, heavy-handed production, and though Xzibit's subject matter ranges from orgies to the benevolence of his mama, his dexterous rhyming style is a little too undifferentiated. [#10, p.132]
All Aboard Future	These Are Powers	Indie	2009-02-17 00:00:00	Pitchfork	71.0	Their catchier material that front-loads the record is so distinct and stunning, however, that it's hard not to be left wanting more after those opening tracks.
American Classic	Willie Nelson	Pop	2009-08-25 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	67.0	Where 1978’s seminal Stardust was a major statement about the timeless power of a great song, the self-consciously minor American Classic is more of a breezy, diverting aside.
Grinderman	Grinderman	Rock	2007-04-10 00:00:00	Billboard	83.0	It may not pick up many new fans or even appeal to those beyond Cave's core audience, but these guys sound like they're having too much fun to care. [14 Apr 2007]
Little Joy	Little Joy	Indie	2008-11-04 00:00:00	Pitchfork	71.0	Little Joy is not going to stop the world or change your life, but it's one of the sweetest, most listenable, consistently enjoyable records of the season.
Unorthodox Jukebox	Bruno Mars	Pop	2012-12-11 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	70.0	The result is a record that makes the competition sound sad and idea-starved by comparison.

Get Behind Me Satan	The White Stripes	Indie	2005-06-07 00:00:00	Delusions of Adequacy	81.0	Both more deeply melodic and somehow more resigned and melancholy than his previous albums, White’s latest may just be his best.
Dear God, I Hate Myself	Xiu Xiu	Indie	2010-02-23 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	74.0	Most of the remaining 11 songs on  Dear God, I Hate Myself are built around sequencers and beats rather than guitars, and while they’ve by no means called off their flirtations with dramatic bursts of noise, they are only intermittent over the 38 minutes
Common Existence	Thursday	Rock	2009-02-17 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	72.0	Common Existence is long on complicated instrumental textures and twisty-turny song structures yet woefully short on the fist-pumping melodies that keep this kind of stuff from sounding like musical math.

Government Commissions: BBC Sessions 1996-2003	Mogwai	Indie	2005-02-22 00:00:00	AllMusic	79.0	Though die-hard Mogwai fans are probably the most likely to pick this up, Government Commissions works so well that it could also double as a Mogwai greatest-hits collection.
Rebelution	Pitbull	Rap	2009-09-01 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	51.0	The highlight is the laid-back Across The World with B.o.B, where Pitbull gets introspective for a minute. “Mr. 305” is at his best when tying together different styles, but the mindless, misogynistic filler on tracks like Full Of Shit and Girls sours the album as a whole.

Pink Friday	Nicki Minaj	Pop	2010-11-22 00:00:00	Pitchfork	68.0	The gulf between Minaj's public persona and her music here reminds me of the criticism laid at the feet of Lady Gaga -- that for all of her high-culture namedropping, wearable art, and big event videos, Gaga's music rarely reflects the full range of her conceptual constructions.

The Hawk Is Howling	Mogwai	Rock	2008-09-23 00:00:00	Q Magazine	76.0	"The Hawk Is Howling is similarly impressive [to ""Mr. Beast""], the band's earlier experiments in noise more reined in, allowing a subtle and textured approach. [Oct 2008, p.149]"

Words to the Blind	Savages	Pop/Rock	2014-11-17 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	66.0	They may have failed in capturing the spirit of the Dadaists, but then it’s unlikely anyone would really have enjoyed that much anyway. What we get instead is two bands playing, not in opposition, but in perfect, complementing disharmony.

Tied to the Moon	Rachel Sermanni	Folk	2015-07-10 00:00:00	The Observer (UK)	79.0	Tied to the Moon is a captivating follow-up to her 2012 debut, Under Mountains, offering a richer, darker take on the soft folk of that record.
Burst Apart	The Antlers	Pop/Rock	2011-05-10 00:00:00	Delusions of Adequacy	81.0	It's best to purely take in the dissimilarity of this exceptional new album in contrast to Hospice--it's downright astonishing on its very own.
Lose	Cymbals Eat Guitars	Pop/Rock	2014-08-26 00:00:00	Pitchfork	78.0	A sprawling, complex, and fascinating document of American indie rock.
It's Not Me, It's You	Lily Allen	Rock	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Under The Radar	71.0	So to sum up, insightful lyrics, great voice, and super production values add up to one of the albums to beat in early 2009. [Winter 2009]
Surf	Donnie Trumpet & The Social Experiment	Rap	2015-05-29 00:00:00	PopMatters	86.0	It’s a rare record that exists due to the harmonious power of its collaborators, but the reason why it will have a lasting legacy is due to how utterly fresh it feels, making for the rare kind of album that sounds just as accessible on its first listen as it does on its hundredth.
Phosphene Dream	The Black Angels	Pop/Rock	2010-09-14 00:00:00	Q Magazine	70.0	It's what Spiritualized might sound like before Jason Pierce sprinkles his gospel fairy dust on them. [Oct 2010, p.104]
Sound The Alarm	Saves the Day	Rock	2006-04-11 00:00:00	PopMatters	64.0	Saves the Day have given their fans nothing exciting, innovative, or new.

Maladroit	Weezer	Rock	2002-05-14 00:00:00	PopMatters	72.0	While Pinkerton was a jarringly beautiful listen, Maladroit is more of a punchy, messy pop record.
Something Wicked This Way Comes	The Herbaliser	Electronic	2002-03-19 00:00:00	Splendid	81.0	A winning combination of hip-hop beats, horns, strings and cinematic soundscapes, the album is spiced with precise scratching and effectively abrupt changes in direction.
The Difference Between Houses And Homes: Lost Songs And Loose Ends 1995-2001	Cursive	Indie	2005-08-09 00:00:00	Junkmedia	61.0	Surprisingly, the time frame covered by the collection does not detract from the listening experience, rewarding Cursive-completists with moments of power punk and the angular guitar work the band has come to be known for.
Long.Live.A$AP	A$AP Rocky	Rap	2013-01-15 00:00:00	Boston Globe	75.0	Harlem's A$AP Rocky finally delivers his long delayed major label debut, and while it builds on his mixtape legacy and emphasizes his strengths as an inventive stylist, it also amplifies his flaws.

Hypnotic Eye	Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers	Pop/Rock	2014-07-29 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	77.0	Decades from now, Petty people will wonder at how a modest marvel like Hypnotic Eye aged into a late-career riff rocket.
The Best Of Blur	Blur	Rock	2000-11-21 00:00:00	AllMusic	88.0	"And ""dazzling"" isn't really hyperbole -- based on these 18 songs, Blur isn't just the best pop band of the '90s, with greater range and depth than their peers, they rank among the best pop bands of all time. The Best of Blur illustrates that, even as it misses some of their best moments -- omissions that prevent it from being the flat-out classic it should be. Even so, it's pretty damn terrific, particularly for the unconverted."
TKOL RMX 1234567	Radiohead	Pop/Rock	2011-10-11 00:00:00	PopMatters	67.0	Too often TKOL RMX 1234567 feels as calculated and mechanical as its soulless title.
Out My Window	Koushik	Indie	2008-09-30 00:00:00	The Guardian	75.0	Most of the album is swathed in hazy reverb; initially, this is pleasingly disorientating, but ultimately proves anaesthetising.
Awake Is The New Sleep	Ben Lee	Rock	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Splendid	57.0	Awake is a distinctly flawed album; much of what's here is precious or forced-sounding.
Letherette	Letherette	Electronic	2013-04-16 00:00:00	Q Magazine	64.0	Their take on the latter's [Rustie's] maximal funk inevitably lacks the shock of the new, a heard-it-all-before feeling which persists through bumping house jams and detours into vintage jazz. [Jun 2013, p.100]

Move in Spectrums	Au Revoir Simone	Pop/Rock	2013-09-24 00:00:00	Q Magazine	76.0	More Than and We Both Know's saturnine piano chords offer a novel contrast to crisp synth-pop such as Somebody Who, where their talent for alluring yet artless arrangements really comes into its own. [Nov 2013, p.102]
Alight Of Night	Crystal Stilts	Indie	2008-10-28 00:00:00	Pitchfork	76.0	Crystal Stilts make terrific use of their recycled material, appropriating favorite forebears' brooding moves (and their richly endowed signifiers), and contributing their own deft hooks and stealth energy.
Live at the Mark, Tom & Travis Show (The Enema Strikes Back)	Blink-182	Rock	2000-11-07 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	56.0	It's not that this wise ass trio of lucky punks make terrible music -- their crass, hyperkinetic tunes are just the thing for adolescents who find Green Day too intellectually challenging -- but this collection is wholly unwarranted from a band whose breakthrough album is barely a year old.
Earth To The Dandy Warhols	Dandy Warhols	Rock	2008-08-19 00:00:00	Dot Music	46.0	Earth To The Dandy Warhols is just vacuous mid-tempo babble and clatter.

Cease To Begin	Band of Horses	Indie	2007-10-09 00:00:00	Q Magazine	78.0	From the anthem-like 'Ode To LRC to the sanguine finale of 'Window Blues,' this is beautifully paced and utterly beguiling. [Dec 2007, p.112]
On The Outside	Starsailor	Rock	2006-08-22 00:00:00	Pitchfork	64.0	Like every jerk who reads an Orwell or Rand novel and walks around a few days with a chip on his/her shoulder, Starsailor play the self-righteous yet simplistic social critic.
Olympia	Bryan Ferry	Pop/Rock	2010-10-25 00:00:00	Boston Globe	72.0	The former Roxy Music frontman doesn't disappoint on his 13th solo album, a mesmerizing swirl of pulsating guitars, whooshing keys, and lite-funk undertones.
The Monitor	Titus Andronicus	Indie	2010-03-09 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	82.0	There's a bloodymindedness on The Monitor that is equally infuriating and invigorating.
Free So Free	J. Mascis & the Fog	Indie	2002-10-08 00:00:00	The Wire	72.0	After long, lean years of straight edge piety and arthouse restraint, guitar solos that don't hold anything back are as refreshing as they are liberating. [#224, p.56]
Live Music	The Strange Boys	Pop/Rock	2011-10-24 00:00:00	Pitchfork	67.0	The album is restrained, surprisingly low-key, and-- at its lowest points-- polite.
New Brigade	Iceage	Pop/Rock	2011-06-21 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	85.0	The success of the album lies partly in the production, which allows the teenagers close to the limits of acceptable disorder, but reins them in and lays on the quality when needed.
Black Ice	AC/DC	Rock	2008-10-20 00:00:00	Uncut	69.0	If Black Ice has a weakness, it’s that it betrays an anxiety. As if AC/DC really might be uncharacteristically worried that their grasp on the planet is in danger of slipping. As if they’ve tried to discreetly update their sound, while hoping that their rebarbative old fans won’t notice what they’ve done. Invincibility suits AC/DC. Self-doubt, even a microscopic hint of it, does not.
Seraph	Mas Ysa	Electronic	2015-07-24 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	69.0	While Seraph is a consistent debut, there is nothing here as immediately drawing as “Why” or “Shame” from the Worthy EP. But Arsenault holding back is still more emotive than most artists firing on all cylinders.
I Guess Sometimes I Need to Be Reminded Of How Much You Love Me	Magnetophone	Rock	2000-11-07 00:00:00	Alternative Press	54.0	Not much on Magnetophone's debut really distinguishes them from the legion of bedroom-based nerds playing with the same breakbeats and software as they do. [March 2001, p.83]
Big TV	White Lies	Pop/Rock	2013-08-20 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	64.0	As a whole, though, the album’s overall feel is still deadeningly generic.

Takk...	Sigur Rós	Indie	2005-09-13 00:00:00	Splendid	84.0	Their expanded sound, with its explosions of noise and romantic swells, deserves reconsideration by fans and skeptics alike.
Another Eternity	Purity Ring	Electronic	2015-03-03 00:00:00	Pitchfork	70.0	This obsession with connecting and disappearing in rapid succession is fitting for a record that finds Purity Ring trying to stake their claim at pop's center but ultimately retreating within themselves.
The Sound Of The Smiths	The Smiths	Indie	2008-11-11 00:00:00	Pitchfork	88.0	The first disc is fine, containing most of the band's singles and a few key album tracks. The second is messier.
Robert Pollard Is Off To Business	Robert Pollard	Indie	2008-06-10 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	73.0	Off to Business--released eponymously by Guided By Voices, Inc.--is the ultimate product of this trend: an album full of ebullient mid-tempo rockers, ebullient pretty guitar parts, and ebullient power drum fills.

Getting Away With Murder	Papa Roach	Rock	2004-08-31 00:00:00	The New York Times	59.0	The new songs are thrashing hard rock that always pays attention to melody.
This Is All Yours	Alt-J	Pop/Rock	2014-09-22 00:00:00	AllMusic	70.0	That penchant for edgy refinement, along with frontman Joe Newman's impossibly fluid voice, remains the band's most effective weapon, but it's hard to pinpoint where and when that magic occurs, as it's so effortlessly woven into the group's sound.
Shenanigans	Green Day	Rock	2002-07-02 00:00:00	Quexor	61.0	"A very underrated album by Green Day.

The Boy With No Name	Travis	Rock	2007-05-08 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	57.0	"Occasionally they attempt to rise above their signature light Brit-pop sound with slightly heavier tunes like ""My Eyes Wide Open,"" but it comes off as forced."
Time Stays, We Go	The Veils	Pop/Rock	2013-04-23 00:00:00	Q Magazine	61.0	When they're not trying to be someone else, these lavishly layered, exquisitely crafted songs add to the mystery of why The Veils keep missing out. [Jul 2013, p.112]
Shedding Skin	Ghostpoet	Electronic	2015-03-17 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	74.0	The record is alive. It has punch, guts, heart, all the things you would hope for really, whilst at the same time maintaining the central potency of what made Ghostpoet so great in the first place: that voice, delivering paeans to lost love and the reality of life like really no-one else can.
Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse	Mariah Carey	Pop	2014-05-27 00:00:00	Fact Magazine (UK)	67.0	Despite her Instagram and “turnt-up” references, the bounce brought to the album by of-the-moment hitmakers like MikeWiLLMadeIt and Hit-Boy and her undeniably personal subject matter, the record just doesn’t have the same candid, bold edge that characterised Beyonce’s huge statement.
Open Your Heart	The Men	Pop/Rock	2012-03-06 00:00:00	PopMatters	83.0	This album is worth a listen. It's too watered down to stand the test of time, but right now, it hits the spot.
II Trill	Bun B	Rap	2008-05-20 00:00:00	RapReviews.com	82.0	With II Trill Bun B's ensured the legacy of U.G.K. will exist for decades to come, but more importantly he's created the album that every hip-hop head from North to South with have rattling out of their trunk all summer long.
Theology	Sinéad O'Connor	Rock	2007-06-26 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	50.0	It's a tale of two cities that was better off reaching an accord for a single CD.
Dirty Work	All Time Low	Pop/Rock	2011-06-07 00:00:00	saulcampion	67.0	While no Don't Panic, Dirty Work was the pinnacle of the bands career up until this point. It's a big progression from the endearing but vapidWhile no Don't Panic, Dirty Work was the pinnacle of the bands career up until this point. It's a big progression from the endearing but vapid collection that was Nothing Personal. The pop songs here are shamelessly committed, the highlights of which are the first three tracks, Do You Want Me, the tongue in cheek party stomper that is I Feel Like Dancin' and Forget About It. Much of the rest of the album is a huge step up. The love songs are particularly poignant, with A Daydream Away, No Idea and Under A Paper Moon, while the possible pinnacle of the album is the charged Guts. Gaskarth's vocals are increasingly mature, a competent if uninspiring singer who gets to the heart of the songs in his delivery. Unfortunate is the musical repetition, with tame drumming from a talented craftsman and wall of sound delivery from the guitarist. Jack Barakat isn't the best guitarist in the business, as evidenced by his solo in Guts, but more augmentations during vocal parts would have considerably spiced up the songs. A good album from a band that is still yet to fulfil it large potential.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Witching Hour	Ladytron	Indie	2005-10-04 00:00:00	PopMatters	78.0	While Witching Hour has the band sounding more adventurous, there's a consistency to the tracks that holds it all together.
Terra Incognita	Juliette Lewis	Rock	2009-09-01 00:00:00	Mojo	56.0	Juliette Lewis's third shot at crossing over from award-winning actress to respected songwriter appears to br gatherng pace. [Oct 2009, p.98]
Wilderness	The Handsome Family	Folk	2013-05-14 00:00:00	Q Magazine	76.0	Wilderness quickly makes it clear that the passing of time hasn't dampened down their taste for the macabre mysteries if existence. [Jul 2013, p.105]
Dark Energy	Jlin	Electronic	2015-03-24 00:00:00	The Quietus	87.0	In its breadth of ambition and stunningly realised sounds, Dark Energy delivers more than just a new twist on an established style. Remaining tightly linked to the music of Jlin's forebears and contemporaries, it nonetheless maps out an inspiring and tantalising glimpse of electronic music's future.
The  Gathering	Arbouretum	Pop/Rock	2011-02-15 00:00:00	Filter	75.0	Pretty cheesy lyrics are by no means strangers to this genre, but that doesn't make them any more welcome. Still, few modern-day axemen can noodle like Heumann, which, let's face it, is why anyone should listen to Arbouretum in the first place.
Undun	The Roots	Rap	2011-12-06 00:00:00	PopMatters	88.0	Despite its various faults, undun is righteously solid.
Overexposed	Maroon 5	Pop	2012-06-26 00:00:00	PopMatters	54.0	Overexposed is not a great album, but that doesn't mean it's not interesting. What we're hearing is the band actually learning to have fun again, and with any luck, they'll only get better from here.
A Wasteland Companion	M. Ward	Pop/Rock	2012-04-10 00:00:00	PopMatters	75.0	Throughout, Ward's smoky, beguiling voice and ebb-and-flow guitar lines create the sense that every song has a secret to guard, and that it's up to the listener to uncover it.
Tha Funk Capital Of The World	Bootsy Collins	R&B;	2011-04-26 00:00:00	BBC Music	69.0	Bootsy sets about waking up a new generation to funk's heritage.
Jazz Mind	Ed Schrader's Music Beat	Jazz	2012-03-20 00:00:00	Exclaim	76.0	Although the switch in tempo and style from song to song is abrupt, there's consistency that follows the album through to the end.
Kill the Wolf	Matt Berry	Pop/Rock	2013-07-16 00:00:00	Record Collector	71.0	While Knock Knock and The Signs admittedly veer close to theatrical, declamatory pastiche, Solstice--which laudably endeavours to track the journey from the shortest to the longest day-- is nine-and-a-half minutes of bona-fide neo-prog: a shimmering three-way between Camel, the Super Furries and David Gilmour.
Acrobats	Peggy Sue	Pop/Rock	2011-10-25 00:00:00	Blurt Magazine	73.0	Peggy Sue's Acrobats is one of the most scattered, schizophrenic, soul questioning--and beautiful and best records of the year.
Morning/Evening	Four Tet	Electronic	2015-07-10 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	77.0	"Club beats pound on ""Morning,"" then dissolve; ""Evening"" flips and reverses the arc--an invitation to click ""repeat"" and play it all day."

More!	Booka Shade	Electronic	2010-05-04 00:00:00	XLR8r	62.0	The resulting album, which has been 18 months in the making, is certainly more complicated, although not more sophisticated than previous work.
Scarecrow	Garth Brooks	Country	2001-11-13 00:00:00	CDNow	77.0	Scarecrow is a fine album, one that can be placed favorably next to Brooks' career milestones No Fences and Ropin' the Wind.
Mr. A-Z	Jason Mraz	Rock	2005-07-26 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	58.0	What makes this glossy album more charming than cloying overall is the totally unselfconscious way he throws himself into these showy and technically stunning performances. [Aug/Sep 2005, p.111]
Quaristice	Autechre	Electronic	2008-03-04 00:00:00	MatthewB.	71.0	The first time I listened to this I skimmed through the beginnings of a few tracks, and thought it wasn&#039;t anything special.

More Tales from the Orbservatory	The Orb	Electronic	2013-06-11 00:00:00	The Independent (UK)	61.0	These tracks offer a similar union of the imaginative and the inspirational, with Lee Perry and The Orb's Alex Paterson and Thomas Fehlmann making musical magic from the most minimal of resources.
Down In Albion	Babyshambles	Indie	2006-02-14 00:00:00	The Guardian	56.0	Much like its maker, the album stumbles from peak to trough, testing the listener's patience while retaining its eccentric charm.
Nightmare Ending	Eluvium	Electronic	2013-05-14 00:00:00	AllMusic	81.0	Cooper's ability to infuse a very human emotional arc into his wordless sheets of sound is a large part of what's made his body of work so captivating. Electronic webs meet with patient piano moments throughout Nightmare Ending, sometimes casting heavy shadows of fear or pain, other times offering relief from that very pain.
Recovery	Eminem	Rap	2010-06-22 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	63.0	"While the endless atonement metaphors threaten to make Recovery a maudlin affair, at moments like these [""Won't Back Down"" and ""No Love""], Eminem soars over his lowered expectations."
The Way I'm Livin'	Lee Ann Womack	Country	2014-09-23 00:00:00	Uncut	84.0	A substantive whomp on the butt to typical Nashville superficialities.  [Dec 2014, p.83]
Frankie Rose and the Outs	Frankie Rose and the Outs	Pop/Rock	2010-09-21 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	72.0	On this album she proves herself as something more (way more, in fact) than an eternal scenester and competent drummer.
Hidden	These New Puritans	Indie	2010-03-02 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	83.0	Here we are not even two years later and the band has taken a huge leap forward. Or, more accurately, sideways. Nothing in the angular post-punk of 08's Beat Pyramid suggested the band was capable of something this novel.
Curses	Rye Coalition	Indie	2006-04-18 00:00:00	Alternative Press	61.0	Curses is all jutting hips, attitudinal riffs and massive kick drums that demand fists be pumped in the air. [Jun 2006, p.186]
Bangerz	Miley Cyrus	Pop/Rock	2013-10-08 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	61.0	Some skeptics--let's call them haters--might argue that Cyrus isn't wholly comfortable in her new dirty/crazy persona. But that's part of the strange charm.
Minor Love	Adam Green	Indie	2010-02-16 00:00:00	PopMatters	70.0	Minor Love proves that Adam Green can be thoughtful and he can be nice. What’s more, he wears it well.
The 2nd Law	Muse	Alternative/Indie Rock	2012-10-02 00:00:00	Uncut	70.0	Muse redeem high-camp absurdity with a genius for sumptuous arrangements, mighty pop hooks and irresistible melodrama. [Nov 2012, p.79]
Ellipse	Imogen Heap	Rock	2009-08-25 00:00:00	Alternative Press	68.0	Ellipse is balanced but doesn't break ground. Fans of her past work will likely find little to quarrel with, but they won't be challenged, either. [Sep 2009, p.105]

Tanglewood Numbers	Silver Jews	Indie	2005-10-18 00:00:00	Magnet	81.0	What's missing most will probably not be missed at all: Berman's tendency to sound slack, sluggish and a bit lackluster. [#69, p.109]

Moon Tides	Pure Bathing Culture	Pop/Rock	2013-08-20 00:00:00	Filter	75.0	In short, the band brilliantly harks back to the nearly forgotten art of blissful pop.
Reset	Atari Teenage Riot	Electronic	2015-02-09 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	75.0	For all its blaring noise and sneering obnoxiousness, its probably ATR’s most accessible album; playing Reset feels like lighting a fuse and detonating something.
Lese Majesty	Shabazz Palaces	Rap	2014-07-29 00:00:00	Exclaim	81.0	Shabazz Palaces offer an ethereal conglomerate with a prophetic voice, a gutsy move that's more than paid off here.
Matinee	Jack Penate	Indie	2008-01-22 00:00:00	Blender	53.0	Even when he tries to make a connection between pickup lines and international tension, in “Made of Codes,” Peñate never forgets that even quasi-protest songs need a good beat.
What Is This Heart?	How to Dress Well	R&B;	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Exclaim	69.0	It moves Krell closer to the mainstream without sacrificing the emotional complexity of his music, proving that Krell is a musical force not to be underestimated.
Croweology	The Black Crowes	Pop/Rock	2010-08-03 00:00:00	PopMatters	69.0	Though it may not showcase any new original material, it at least gives the feeling that the Black Crowes are not about to let their next hiatus wash them away in a wave of unsatisfying nostalgia: they will leave us only looking for more.
Kingdom Come	Jay-Z	Rap	2006-11-21 00:00:00	PopMatters	67.0	Kingdom Come is a solid record, and entirely worth the cost just to hear Jay-Z spit a new song, but in the end it just can’t live up the expectations it tattoos all over itself.

Axis Of Evol	Pink Mountaintops	Indie	2006-03-07 00:00:00	AllMusic	75.0	A set of tracks that sound akin to an amalgamation of John Frusciante's early solo work and the great Skip Spence.
BLACKsummers'night	Maxwell	R&B;	2009-07-07 00:00:00	Los Angeles Times	85.0	For those who like their pop delicate and unapologetically deep, this is one for turning up loud and wallowing.

I Am the West	Ice Cube	Rap	2010-09-28 00:00:00	BBC Music	62.0	While the leader has become absorbed by the pack, however, at least I Am the West doesn't go down without a mouthy fight.
Alive As You Are	Darker My Love	Pop/Rock	2010-08-17 00:00:00	AllMusic	66.0	While fans of Darker My Love's earlier albums may be a bit put off by this sudden sea change, Alive as You Are  marks a pleasant sonic shift for the band, offering anyone willing to listen a love letter to San Francisco's psych-pop past and the sounds of the paisley underground.
Major	Fang Island	Pop/Rock	2012-07-24 00:00:00	AllMusic	78.0	Major feels like the coolest church service ever, devoid of dogma and ritual, and consecrated by the unholy smack of a thousand high-fives.
A Bigger Bang	The Rolling Stones	Rock	2005-09-06 00:00:00	Blender	73.0	"Without playing ""best since"" games, just say it ranks near the top of the eight [albums] they've manufactured since 1980. [Oct 2005, p.142]"
Raising Sand	Robert Plant And Alison Krauss	Folk	2007-10-23 00:00:00	No Ripcord	87.0	This collection is simply a joy to listen to, with great singers lovingly rendering great songs with a talented producer at the helm.
Into The Blue Again	The Album Leaf	Indie	2006-09-12 00:00:00	DustinT	67.0	Super solid album. I found a huge improvement in their production from their last release.
Hexadic	Six Organs of Admittance	Pop/Rock	2015-02-17 00:00:00	The Quietus	67.0	Ultimately, Hexadic is more compelling as a concept than a piece of music, and few folks are likely to follow Chasny deep into the record's blistering hot core more than a couple times.
Tape Deck Heart	Frank Turner	Pop/Rock	2013-04-23 00:00:00	BKM	76.0	There aren't as many as invigorating, reach for the sky ballads as on his last album, but that doesn't mean that this is a rock record thatThere aren't as many as invigorating, reach for the sky ballads as on his last album, but that doesn't mean that this is a rock record that fails to rock.

Written In Chalk	Buddy & Julie Miller	Country	2009-03-03 00:00:00	Mojo	81.0	Most are country ballads--sentimental, heartfelt and tend towards sacred. [Apr 2009, p.109]
Them Crooked Vultures	Them Crooked Vultures	Rock	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Uncut	75.0	In their careers, this band might prove to be a sideshow. But right now, it's one with the possibility of being as gripping as the main event. [Jan 2010, p. 104]

GO:OD AM	Mac Miller	Rap	2015-09-18 00:00:00	Billboard.com	75.0	On major-label debut GO:OD AM, his third and best studio album, Miller grapples frankly with fame, addiction, recovery and the struggle to be a decent person over taut, melancholy production that channels both bleary inebriation and hard-fought optimism.
Joan Of Arc, Dick Cheney, Mark Twain...	Joan of Arc	Indie	2004-08-24 00:00:00	AllMusic	70.0	Though their words suggest such weighty topics, the album remains sonically airy. It might get tense, but it's never dense.
Bend Beyond	Woods	Folk	2012-09-18 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	79.0	With fewer experimental throwaways, the album puts the band's best foot forward: toe-tapping, harmony-laden kernels of pop.
We Shall All Be Healed	The Mountain Goats	Indie	2004-02-03 00:00:00	Delusions of Adequacy	77.0	This is a revelatory album for the Mountain Goats and the listeners; both Darnielle and the audience find new strength in his open vulnerability.
Trick	Kele	Electronic	2014-10-14 00:00:00	Brickfaced	67.0	The Boxer derived from an eclectic mix of styles, drifting from the jittery electronics of Walk Tall, to the deadened acoustics of The NewThe Boxer derived from an eclectic mix of styles, drifting from the jittery electronics of Walk Tall, to the deadened acoustics of The New Rules, to the familiar indie rock roots of Unholy Thoughts, whereas Trick almost exclusively strikes out in a 90s garage R&B; style. Simply put, The Boxer felt like a disconnected collection of songs, but Trick feels like...well, it actually feels like an album!Okereke’s past of interview avoidance and question dodging has always given him that awkward serious frontman persona, and as a member of Bloc Party, this persona always felt correct where the lyrics were concerned. And so when we get our ‘First Impressions’ from Trick, where Okereke sings ‘you're taking over me’ and ‘it’s only you I see’ we can immediately feel that serious frontman peel away, and for the rest of the record, we hear a different man. That is to say, Kele does everything Kele doesn’t ever do. This can be a bit intrusive at times, but Trick does at least offer a refreshing change from the more usual distance Okereke builds between himself and his audience.Unfortunately, Okereke does often fall victim to poeticism and overindulgence, and while his heart on sleeve approach is endearing at first, a little subtlety is something that would definitely be welcomed as the record progresses. That said, it isn’t too hard to look past overdone romanticism thanks to a sublime mixture of rhythmic electronics, ambiance and complimentary duets (think The xx having a love child with a decade of garage house), making tracks like First Impressions and Closer easy listening if nothing else.Regardless of your stance on the record, Trick doesn’t feel so much a project or an experiment as it does a testament to the man behind it, because for once, it’s a record where he truly feels at home. And to that end of things, there is very little criticism you can give him.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Benji	Sun Kil Moon	Pop/Rock	2014-02-11 00:00:00	PopMatters	85.0	Benji is the sound of an artist giving his heart to his fans and saying, “Do with it what you will.” That kind of vulnerability is a rare quality in the music business and as such, should be revered.
Less Than Human	The Juan MacLean	Indie	2005-08-09 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	81.0	Less Than Human is the sound of James Murphy transforming the songs of a guy who has spent a nauseating amount of time fiddling about with Kraftwerk-y synths into an album as enjoyable at home as it is on the dancefloor.
Playland	Johnny Marr	Pop/Rock	2014-10-07 00:00:00	AllMusic	70.0	All this means that Playland is superficially more pop with all its style and flair, but it plays more like a rock & roll album, always in a hurry to make its point understood as quickly as possible.

Embryonic	The Flaming Lips	Rock	2009-10-13 00:00:00	The Guardian	81.0	For all its flaws and failings, for all that you may never feel like listening to it again, it's hard not to be perversely glad Embryonic exists.
Venice	Fennesz	Electronic	2004-03-22 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	82.0	The most pressing problem is that Venice is rarely a challenging release.

The Datsuns	The Datsuns	Rock	2003-02-18 00:00:00	Ink 19	67.0	The Datsuns' biggest problem isn't the style of music they're playing, though. It's the sub-standard quality of their songwriting, the uninspired performances on here and the fundamental lack of willingness to stretch beyond the safe confines of their older brothers' record collections.
All Day	Girl Talk	Electronic	2010-11-15 00:00:00	Okayplayer	79.0	All Day offers a departure of sorts from Night Ripper and Feed the Animals, his previous releases.

Black Dog Barking	Airbourne	Pop/Rock	2013-05-21 00:00:00	Revolver	76.0	From the anthemic confidence of “Back in the Game” to the speed-metal boogie of “Hungry,” frontman Joel O’Keeffe rasps out memorable, bluesy melodies without sacrificing the AC/DC-inspired passion of 2007’s Runnin’ Wild.
Same As You	Polar Bear	Jazz	2015-04-14 00:00:00	The Observer (UK)	79.0	The urban electronica of 2014’s In Each and Every One is sidelined for a spacier, more minimalist sound.
Monuments to an Elegy	Smashing Pumpkins	Pop/Rock	2014-12-09 00:00:00	sanserif	70.0	To me, Monuments sounds kind of like if you took the songwriting style of Machina and TheFutureEmbrace and mixed it with the production styleTo me, Monuments sounds kind of like if you took the songwriting style of Machina and TheFutureEmbrace and mixed it with the production style of Mellon Collie and The Aeroplane Flies High. It rocks but it's also some of the catchiest, poppiest music Corgan's written in about a decade. If you approach it with an open mind, it's a very fun and enjoyable album. If you have preconceived expectations, you might not enjoy it as much.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Made In China	Juliana Hatfield	Indie	2005-08-09 00:00:00	Trouser Press	63.0	Made in China is a raw, angry album that is difficult to endure at points due to the emotionally naked lyrics, but the lo-fi, almost punky, music is a perfect fit.
Body Talk	Robyn	Pop	2010-11-22 00:00:00	AllMusic	86.0	Overall, though, Body Talk is more focused than Robyn, and just as bold in the intimacy it creates with listeners.
Encore	Eminem	Rap	2004-11-12 00:00:00	Pitchfork	64.0	Encore is a fourth fascinating record from Eminem, but it's also easily his weakest and, in many ways, tamest album to date.
Cover Magazine	Giant Sand	Indie	2002-03-19 00:00:00	The Wire	71.0	Jocular and enjoyable to flip through, but the nagging feeling that leaks through is that this collection is little more than a respite for Giant Sand until Gelb returns from the bunker with enough fresh material to record a real new album. [#216, p.63]
The Intercontinentals	Bill Frisell	Jazz	2003-04-15 00:00:00	Blender	86.0	An album of languid grooves and slowly descending melodies. [#16, p.117]

I Love You, Honeybear	Father John Misty	Pop/Rock	2015-02-10 00:00:00	The 405	87.0	Honeybear is rich with sarcasm, flagrant in some places and barely discernable in others. It is impossible to take seriously, but too damn compelling to be dismissed.
Howl	Black Rebel Motorcycle Club	Indie	2005-08-23 00:00:00	Spin	70.0	"Howl is not exactly the group's Nebraska--BRMC dabble in too much ""White Album"" Beatlemania for that--but it's a general extension of that record. [Sep 2005, p.101]"
Cat's Eyes	Cat's Eyes	Pop/Rock	2011-05-17 00:00:00	AllMusic	79.0	Cat's Eyes is an intriguing album of heartbroken, shadowy pop that transcends its influences when it aims directly for the heart.
Free Your Mind	Cut Copy	Electronic	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Boston Globe	68.0	A few too many tone-shifting interludes slow down momentum, but “Free Your Mind,” “We Are Explorers,” and “In Memory Capsule” in particular are a welcoming embrace into a sea of moving bodies and blinking lights that extends as far as the eye can see.
Odditorium Or Warlords Of Mars	Dandy Warhols	Rock	2005-09-13 00:00:00	Under The Radar	57.0	Though it at first struggles to find its legs, Odditorium is as satisfying as anything the band's ever done. [#10, p.106]

Teaspoon To The Ocean	Jib Kidder	Pop/Rock	2015-01-27 00:00:00	Uncut	70.0	It's neither pastiche nor parody, corralling '60s psychedelia, prog, Indian ragas, country rock, '50s lounge music and Javanese campursari into his vision. [Feb 2015, p.79]
Monaco	Monaco	Rock	2000-08-21 00:00:00	Mojo	72.0	The synth-laden tunes are relentlessly upbeat--sort of New Order on Prozac--with a Lightning Seeds blitheness.... Though no groundbreaker, 'Monaco' is catchy as flu.
Stupid Love	Mindy Smith	Folk	2009-08-11 00:00:00	The New York Times	62.0	This is a scattered, sometimes awkward effort from a singer who has been, until now, tonally consistent and confident.

Once More 'Round the Sun	Mastodon	Pop/Rock	2014-06-24 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	78.0	Mastodon has made an album that breaks little new ground--but thanks to Once More ’Round The Sun’s balance between a light touch and a heavy vibe, it doesn’t have to.
The  Lost Tapes	Rodion G.A.	Electronic	2013-05-28 00:00:00	The Quietus	84.0	This is some of the raddest music you’re likely to hear this year.

Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action	Franz Ferdinand	Pop/Rock	2013-08-27 00:00:00	Boston Globe	71.0	This is the album for people who used to be Franz Ferdinand fans but strayed. It gives them a reason to come back.

Never mind the style of the song, I do miss steel guitar and fiddle, banjo, mandolin. I don&#039;t care for Dolly or Emmylou, but I like the texture of country instruments, so it&#039;s a shame she&#039;s abandoned them. That said, she&#039;s still a great performer, and some of these songs are pretty good. I think she should get over wanting to be a diva, but you can&#039;t deny her talent, whatever she&#039;s doing.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Underneath the Pine	Toro y Moi	Pop/Rock	2011-02-22 00:00:00	Pitchfork	79.0	Because Toro Y Moi is so closely linked with the likes of Neon Indian, Washed Out, and Memory Tapes, it's tempting to read into the success of Underneath the Pine  as some predictor of those bands' collective staying power, or a direction others might take. But Bundick seems to be following nothing but his own internal compass.

Dignity And Shame	Crooked Fingers	Indie	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Lost At Sea	75.0	As with other Crooked Fingers albums, Bachmann’s stories really command most of our attention here, and they serve to elevate his songs beyond just being clever pastiches of pop music.
Vehicles & Animals	Athlete	Indie	2004-05-18 00:00:00	Pitchfork	63.0	It's all about finding the friendly turtles at the end of the druggy rainbow, yet, since no one's in a hurry to get there, the songs loop along with space between the beats and guitarists who still seem to be learning their craft.

Don't Stop	Annie	Rock	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	77.0	Some of these songs do, of course, belong on the radio: They’re saturated with production effects catered to a generation that calls its designer drug “ecstasy,” all wrapped around indulgent hooks, sentimental lyrics, and a sweet voice airbrushed into flawlessness. But Annie flaunts too much.
Feels Like Home	Sheryl Crow	Country	2013-09-10 00:00:00	Exclaim	74.0	Yes, on the surface Feels Like Home is a makeover aimed at the parents of every Taylor Swift fan, but the essence of Crow's sound remains intact, and irresistible.
Dude Incredible	Shellac	Pop/Rock	2014-09-16 00:00:00	Uncut	84.0	At 32 minutes, the album doesn't hang about, but offers in that time Shellac's signature intensity and repetition. [Dec 2014, p.80]
I Love You	Amanda Blank	Rap	2009-08-04 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	59.0	While Blank’s reference-heavy, mix-tape mentality isn’t radical in the current musical climate, it’s often fun in its familiarity.
Do It!	Clinic	Indie	2008-04-08 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	69.0	After five albums in just eight years, you could accuse Clinic of being one-note, but in an indie world besotted with cheap revivalism, at least you can't call them a gimmick.
Guero	Beck	Rock	2005-03-29 00:00:00	Mojo	78.0	While there are enough inspiring moments on here to suggest Beck hasn't yet run out of ideas, it demonstrates that the best way for him to revisit former triumphs would be to travel somewhere new. [Apr 2005, p.92]

The Stand Ins	Okkervil River	Indie	2008-09-09 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	78.0	Okkervil River itself performs here with an organic ease that’s dramatic without reaching for histrionics, continuing to tattoo its rough folkish flesh with Motown horns, power-pop overdrive and chugging New Wave bass.

8701	Usher	Pop	2001-08-07 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	67.0	If the album has a fault, it's that Usher never surrenders his meticulously groomed veneer - don't hold your breath for a genuine rawboned holler or hint of reckless spontaneity among these calculated compositions. Still, despite Usher's radio-safe reserve, 8701's wispy slow jams and booming club cuts strike a sweet nerve.

Indestructible	Disturbed	Rock	2008-06-03 00:00:00	PopMatters	57.0	In failing to take up the sword as they should, therefore, they wind up sounding a little lost on Indestructible, stabbing their weapons without any reasons behind each parry, setting up vague agendas they cannot follow through on. Despite this, it’s still a reliably solid, passable hard-rock soundtrack for 2008.

Convertibles	Chuck Inglish	Rap	2014-04-08 00:00:00	Uncut	68.0	The straightforward rap tracks merely show up his generically braggadocio lyricism and deflated hook, using charmless trap cliche and bringing out the leaden, smoke-headed worst in the likes of Action Bronson, Mac Miller and Ab-Soul. [Jun 2014, p.78]
ONoffON	Mission of Burma	Indie	2004-05-04 00:00:00	AllMusic	84.0	Though Onoffon doesn't quite top Burma's 1982 masterpiece Vs., it manages to sound like the more-than-worthy follow-up they could have cut a couple years later ... only with two decades of experience and musical detours informing its nooks and crannies.
Head Up High	Morcheeba	Electronic	2013-10-15 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	57.0	Trouble is, the arrangements on Head Up High are low-key to the point of nothingness.

The Brian Jonestown Massacre	Indie	2010-02-23 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	61.0	Flitting between ambient sequences and army-of-guitars maelstroms, this 71-minute magnum opus was recorded in Berlin and Iceland, but loaded with rampant Anglophilia, evident in a Joy Division homage and John Lennon interview clips.
Cripple Crow	Devendra Banhart	Indie	2005-09-13 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	79.0	Less folky and more eclectic than his past work, Crow offers ample evidence of growth in Banhart’s range as both a performer and a songwriter.

I was on the site looking for reviews of Fullbright's new album ""Songs.""  Let me put it this way: this guy is amazing and going places.  The songs on Ground Up age very well.  I still find myself listening to that album all the way through regularly.  Several songs are on various playlists of mine.  They are solidly built, no frill affairs.  So, they only get better as you get to know them.  Jericho, Satan & St. Paul and at least 4 other stand-outs.  My only criticism: the haircut.

Fate	Dr. Dog	Indie	2008-07-22 00:00:00	Pitchfork	72.0	"Fate still manages to be a master class in illusory ""good"" songwriting. The bulk of it is so fenced into classicist templates-- chamber-y pop meets maximum R&B; with the occasional smidge of ""tasteful"" gospel/parlour games (""Hang On"") that, even when merely competent, it can still win over those unimpressed with all that punk and hip-hop riff raff of the past three decades."

Anything In Return	Toro y Moi	Electronic	2013-01-22 00:00:00	Exclaim	70.0	Anything in Return functions as an all-in-one summary of Bundick's talents, giving the impression of a maturing songwriter who has found his wheelhouse.
METZ	METZ	Pop/Rock	2012-10-09 00:00:00	Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM)	82.0	The sonic corruption and disquieting sense of dread are accomplished with pure muscle alone. But instead of keeping this mindset out in the open, Metz just sweat it out over thirty jarring minutes.

The Sellout	Macy Gray	R&B;	2010-06-22 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	58.0	Despite the title, her new album is a softer sell--and more appealing--than 2007's Will.i.am-assisted Big.

Funeral	Arcade Fire	Indie	2004-09-14 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	90.0	For those of us who still believe in music's power to redeem, 'Funeral' feels like detox, the most cathartic album of the year. [5 Mar 2005, p.49]
Bromst	Dan Deacon	Electronic	2009-03-24 00:00:00	Pitchfork	77.0	The music becomes something like a natural process: one clean, simple sweep, but built from an insane complexity of detail. And there's enough to un-knot in there to make this a terrific step for Deacon--out from the sticky basements into a space where he can try to tackle the sublime.
Broken By Whispers	Trembling Blue Stars	Indie	2000-03-07 00:00:00	Spin	78.0	Interesting as these personal/lyrical developments may be, overall the latest round of self-therapy just isn't quite as tuneful as previous ones.

Love Frequency	Klaxons	Pop/Rock	2014-06-16 00:00:00	Pitchfork	58.0	Love Frequency isn’t a complete disaster, if only because the new, chastised, and chaste Klaxons aren’t really capable of doing anything that could inspire that sort of animus. At their best, Klaxons dredge up the kind of sounds that keep the Coachella Sahara Tent bumping all weekend, composed to be aggressive and participatory, yet strangely ambient and easy to ignore.
Hidden	These New Puritans	Indie	2010-03-02 00:00:00	The Guardian	83.0	Hidden is not just the most original record to emerge from Britain this year, but the most unfathomable: an immaculate enigma.
This Is...	Icona Pop	Pop	2013-09-24 00:00:00	The Fly (UK)	69.0	Basically, you can listen to all 11 tracks of This Is... Icona Pop and have a reasonable time, or you can put I Love It on repeat, forever, and have the time of your life.
Born This Way	Lady Gaga	Electronic	2011-05-23 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	71.0	You have to admire the way Gaga fearlessly throws herself into, say, a disco mariachi arrangement on Americano, but she should be careful: her frequently righteous tone and overindulgence in clunky Catholic metaphors threaten to mire her memorable melodies in schlocky self-help proselytizing.

MAYA	M.I.A.	Electronic	2010-07-13 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	68.0	It's not the world-claiming masterpiece it could have been. But as an evolutionary step from world-party-queen towards a more complex beast, it's intriguing.
Thao & Mirah	Thao & Mirah	Pop/Rock	2011-04-26 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	76.0	Though they thrive on moments where sadness meets levity, and songcraft meets eccentricity, Thao & Mirah doesn't always find them working in sync.
Stone Love	Angie Stone	R&B;	2004-07-06 00:00:00	Dot Music	68.0	"A collection of rootsy yet sophisticated, summery soul grooves, with the usual nods to past masters like Aretha Franklin, Roberta Flack and Glady Knight, ""Stone Love"" is equally at home alongside the sultry, sassy R&B; of contemporaries like Lauryn Hill, Alicia Keys and Erykah Badu."

Caught In The Trees	Damien Jurado	Indie	2008-09-09 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	75.0	Sure, there’s less humour here than Conor Oberst or Okkervil River, but there’s also less caricature, and if Damien Jurado continues to play second fiddle in terms of success, he no longer does so in terms of atmospheric arrangements, captivating tunes, and dark poetry.
Thank Me Later	Drake	Rap	2010-06-15 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	75.0	Drake's hooks are flimsy and irritating. His long-winded emo choruses gnaw at your brain. He complains about fame way too much. He mentions Kelsey Grammer for no reason. He's completely humourless. Worst of all, he sounds like a frog – not like Kermit in Rainbow Connection, but actual croaking.
The  Civil Wars	The Civil Wars	Folk	2013-08-06 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	71.0	Even in the quieter moments, like Williams’ dreamy French lead vocal on “Sacred Heart” and album closer “D’Arline,” there’s the sense that such raw, bare emotion has enabled The Civil Wars to delve deep to intricate details, but also to amplify the internal conflict to greater heights.
Faded Seaside Glamour	Delays	Indie	2004-05-18 00:00:00	Blender	70.0	Delays have found a way to combine the sparkling harmonies of the Byrds with the glorious noise of My Bloody Valentine, and still sound as fresh and surprising as a London heat wave. [#27, p.134]

The Sermon On Exposition Boulevard	Rickie Lee Jones	Rock	2007-02-06 00:00:00	Boston Globe	75.0	"The overall hush of ""Sermon"" occasionally leads down some sleepy roads. But with a real sense of creative spark at its heart, ""Sermon"" is a worthy entry into the Book of Rickie Lee."

Family Man	Shooter Jennings	Country	2012-03-13 00:00:00	Country Weekly	81.0	Lyrically and musically, the songs stream effortlessly from accessible to intricate, creating an estimable country album with a steady undercurrent of blues and rock.
Cardinology	Ryan Adams	Rock	2008-10-28 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	72.0	He has found ways to marry sentiment with strut before, and when it happens here, as it does in the steady march that propels 'Born Into a Light' and the guitar solo bridge on 'Like Yesterday,' the album has a powerful presence. These moments are rare, however, and too often Cardinology seems content to float along on an oily sea of good feelings and bad attitude.
Everything That Happens Will Happen Today	Brian Eno + David Byrne	Rock	2008-11-25 00:00:00	The Boston Phoenix	75.0	Everything That Happens is a brilliant addition to a creative partnership that has yielded so much and shouldn’t have taken 27 years to rekindle.

By The Hedge	Minks	Alternative/Indie Rock	2011-01-25 00:00:00	No Ripcord	75.0	Yeah, Minks has churned out an enjoyable full-length debut, but there's an ever-present possibility that it'll get lost in the mess--much like the standout moments on By the Hedge, there's always a haziness enveloping everything like a dense fog.
Saturn's Pattern	Paul Weller	Pop/Rock	2015-05-19 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	82.0	Weller's 12th solo album is a robust binding of the experimental tangents on 2008's 22 Dreams and 2012's Sonik Kicks into taut, acid-flecked turbulence and modern-dance synthesis.

At.Long.Last.A$AP	A$AP Rocky	Rap	2015-05-26 00:00:00	The Quietus	76.0	Akin to scrolling down a Tumblr dashboard, A.L.L.A as a whole lacks coherence but features some impressive displays of aestheticism.
Paracosm	Washed Out	Pop/Rock	2013-08-13 00:00:00	No Ripcord	73.0	Even though there aren’t any forcible tracks or extreme depth to this album, it captures an experience that should be played out entirely.
Alice	Tom Waits	Rock	2002-05-07 00:00:00	Pitchfork	90.0	While the rest of pop culture infantilizes itself with cussing puppets and manufactured bands who willfully dangle like marionettes, Waits is serving up vintage brittle fusion and somehow breaking the law of diminishing returns.

G Stands For Go-Betweens, Vol. 1 [Box Set]	The Go-Betweens	Pop/Rock	2015-01-20 00:00:00	PopMatters	90.0	G Stands For Go-Betweens Vol.1 tirelessly catalogues the beginning of the story for this band, and it will be a delight for enthusiasts. It is however almost certainly not the place to start for absolute beginners; it would be an overwhelming introduction.
I Am A Bird Now	Antony and the Johnsons	Indie	2005-02-01 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	88.0	I Am A Bird Now is a beautiful, emotive, glorious, and sometimes sinister album that will top many a critic's list come the end-of-year polls, and justifiably so.

Elixer	Bria Valente	R&B;	2009-03-29 00:00:00	Observer Music Monthly	49.0	Elixer is at least a more pleasant listen; ignore the Prince mystique and it's a collection of reasonably well-turned pop ballads.
Mechanical Wonder	Ocean Colour Scene	Rock	2001-05-01 00:00:00	AllMusic	61.0	The problem is that the songwriting has gotten a little mannered, a little undistinguished, and the performances, while sturdy, tend to be slightly flat.
The Glass Bead Game	James Blackshaw	Folk	2009-05-26 00:00:00	Pitchfork	82.0	Blackshaw's musical ideas are interesting enough that it's easy to see his piano pieces progressing as his technique comes along, opening another avenue to explore his musical concepts.
Wot	Mike Donovan	Pop/Rock	2013-10-14 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	73.0	The songs on WOT are about as accessible as any Donovan has ever written, with bright clear melodies, relatively tight structures and minimal instrumental embellishment, but they still resist easy analysis.
Songs From The Floodplain	Jon Boden	Folk	2009-03-02 00:00:00	Uncut	79.0	Boden is a true original who has crafted an engaging album that's no easy listen, but worth sticking with. [May 2009, p.79]

Peanut Butter Blues and Melancholy Jam	Ghostpoet	Rap	2011-02-07 00:00:00	BBC Music	78.0	Rarely does a British debut album forge such a fully formed, genuinely unique direction that attempts to slot it into established scenes prove almost entirely fruitless. But Peanut Butter Blues and Melancholy Jam, the full-length bow of late-20s wisdom dispenser/producer Obaro 'Ghostpoet' Ejimiwe, achieves such a feat.
School Of The Flower	Six Organs of Admittance	Indie	2005-01-25 00:00:00	Q Magazine	83.0	It's essentially easy listening for uneasy people. [Mar 2005, p.101]
Awfully Deep	Roots Manuva	Rap	2005-04-19 00:00:00	Spin	80.0	His third album mostly shelves the wit and sui generis style-clash. [Jun 2005, p.108]
Tron: Legacy	Daft Punk	Electronic	2010-12-07 00:00:00	The Guardian	71.0	It might all work brilliantly in the cinema, allied to Tron: Legacy's 3D visuals. If it does, it wouldn't be the first Daft Punk album to be reconsidered over time: people certainly revised their opinion of Human After All after seeing its tracks performed live.
A Better Tomorrow	Wu-Tang Clan	Rap	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	60.0	While the goodwill is obfuscated by a lack of direction, A Better Tomorrow is made further futile because of the misinformed goal of simply giving the fans another Wu-Tang album.

Bonxie	Stornoway	Alternative/Indie Rock	2015-04-13 00:00:00	The 405	85.0	There is no ignoring the allusions to the natural world. And with big orchestration and even bigger ambition, the band were able to show just how we are only a small part of something much bigger.

All Things Bright and Beautiful	Owl City	Electronic	2011-06-14 00:00:00	No Ripcord	49.0	Owl City is electro-pop's unwanted bastard child, combining all the worst elements of the genre. The production is lazy and unbelievably dull.
The Pale Emperor	Marilyn Manson	Pop/Rock	2015-01-20 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	71.0	What emerges is a classier record than you might expect from Manson--and one that still manages to be the kind of old-fashioned alt-rock tantrum no one bothers throwing these days.
Godspeed On The Devil's Thunder	Cradle of Filth	Rock	2008-10-28 00:00:00	MetalHead	61.0	First and foremost this is a biased opinion of this latest offering from Cradle of Filth
Asiatisch	Fatima Al Qadiri	Electronic	2014-05-06 00:00:00	Exclaim	67.0	The most striking aspect of Asiatisch is the confidence of Al Qadiri's sound, demonstrating that the quality of her music has finally caught up with her artistic ambitions.
Xoxo Panda & The New Kid Revival	Her Space Holiday	Indie	2008-10-07 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	65.0	The announcement of XOXO, Panda And The New Kid Revival heralded if not a double-footed leap of joy, certainly a raised eyebrow and fuzzy, dual sense of a) knowing exactly what to expect and b) being pretty happy about it.
Fanfare	Jonathan Wilson	Pop/Rock	2013-10-15 00:00:00	Clash Music	78.0	While his distinctive voice and keening melodies are as enchanting as ever, Wilson has added a cinematic heft that neatly avoids being saccharine.
All We Are	All We Are	Pop/Rock	2015-02-03 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	68.0	It’s not a bad record, but, ultimately, All We Are lacks energy.
Era Extrana	Neon Indian	Pop/Rock	2011-09-13 00:00:00	Spin	76.0	Era Extraña picks up as if that criticism (and 2010) never happened. Some tracks sound 25 years old and they're one Martin Rushent assist away from being genuine synth-pop hits.
Giving	Collections of Colonies of Bees	Pop/Rock	2011-08-02 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	78.0	Giving aggressively stakes out its territory, never wasting a moment--or a percolating bubble of sound--as it barrels thrillingly forward.
Hot Cakes	The Darkness	Pop/Rock	2012-08-21 00:00:00	The Independent on Sunday (UK)	67.0	Hot Cakes is a rock-solid home win from the band who still do feelgood hard rock better than anyone alive.
Because Of The Times	Kings of Leon	Indie	2007-04-03 00:00:00	Pitchfork	79.0	Flirtations with big-sky atmospherics can hardly hold these songs together. What sounds like a hodgepodge of Edgy experiments and raised-Zippo nostalgia is just that: a hodgepodge.
Two Thousand And Ten Injuries	Love Is All	Indie	2010-03-23 00:00:00	Urb	74.0	The record is a winning release, if not entirely novel, and the sound of a likable band honing their sound while refusing, somewhat obstinately, to alter it.
Don't Tell the Driver	Mick Turner	Pop/Rock	2013-11-19 00:00:00	PopMatters	77.0	Turner’s unpredictable guitar work here is of a piece with the other elements in these compositions, but the ruffled imperfection of it all is quite beautiful in its difficulty.
There Is Love In You	Four Tet	Indie	2010-01-26 00:00:00	Clash Music	82.0	If you love the ambiguous crossover between half-step London sounds and crushed and warped 4/4 peddled by the likes of Martyn, Burial or Joy Orbison, then the love in you will find this album.
Yeezus	Kanye West	Rap	2013-06-18 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	84.0	“Harder, better, faster, stronger”: It was years ago that West first took to that mantra, but it’s on the visceral, unrelenting Yeezus that he fully internalizes it.
As If To Nothing	Craig Armstrong	Electronic	2002-04-16 00:00:00	Alternative Press	71.0	Held together nicely by Armstrong's expertly scored strings and a generally tranquil tone common to most of his work. [Jun 2002, p.71]
Stankonia	Outkast	Rap	2000-10-31 00:00:00	Village Voice	95.0	When talking about an album as multilayered, thematically diverse, and sonically rich as OutKast's Stankonia, though, the best thing is to boil it down to its essentials, its influences, its approaches. You know, the uppercase conceptual stuff. This album, the acclaimed Atlanta duo's fourth and best, contains so many hummable hooks, so many snap-your-head beats, so many break-'em-out-and-talk-about-'em metaphors, that it's easy to get lost in the sauce.
Past Life Martyred Saints	EMA	Pop/Rock	2011-05-10 00:00:00	The Telegraph (UK)	82.0	Blending hi-tech and lo-fi, modern synthesised sound and old-fashioned song writing, her work plumbs torrid emotional depths, similar to alt-rock stars such as Lou Barlow.
The  Worse Things Get, the Harder I Fight, the Harder I Fight, the More I Love You	Neko Case	Country	2013-09-03 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	84.0	It's a tribute to Case's ever-growing strength as a songwriter that she refuses to take the sharp edges off the vicissitudes her songs depict while still acknowledging the humor and occasional beauty of those edges.
Formerly Extinct	Rangda	Pop/Rock	2012-09-18 00:00:00	Pitchfork	78.0	With Formerly Extinct, Rangda not only prove themselves to be a going concern as a band, but that they might just be starting to really hit their stride.
The Most Lamentable Tragedy	Titus Andronicus	Pop/Rock	2015-07-28 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	79.0	You can hear, see, feel Titus Andronicus trying their damnedest, and when the band’s talented musicians aren’t interrupted for the sake of concept, that enthusiasm and the resulting excellent songs pass infectiously to the listener.
Fabriclive 67: Ben UFO	Ben UFO	Electronic	2013-02-12 00:00:00	Fact Magazine (UK)	84.0	Thomson's manifesto is articulate, incisive and practically book-length.
Arabia Mountain	Black Lips	Pop/Rock	2011-06-07 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	80.0	There are some great garage rock tunes, but too much filler to make for a great album. Maybe they should have trimmed a few of the 16 songs for a shorter but stronger work.
Detrola	His Name Is Alive	Indie	2006-01-24 00:00:00	PopMatters	71.0	The biggest problem with the record is how often His Name Is Alive scrap[e] the bottom of this gentle pop vibe, diminishing the early efforts by continuously revisiting the same ground.
Endgame	Rise Against	Pop/Rock	2011-03-15 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	76.0	A fine record from an ever-impressive band.
Love, Shelby	Shelby Lynne	Country	2001-11-13 00:00:00	Spin Cycle	53.0	She keeps shifting gears in an ill-advised attempt to please too broad an audience.
Heartbreak Pass	Giant Sand	Pop/Rock	2015-05-04 00:00:00	Blurt Magazine	79.0	It’s an impressive show of strength and act of endurance not just in its multi-part structure but also in Gelb’s long term commitment to his craft and his determination to make something endearing out of the downcast canvas that he’s made his own.
After the Disco	Broken Bells	Pop/Rock	2014-02-04 00:00:00	Under The Radar	71.0	So, yes, album number two is a step in the right direction, but once again the journey doesn't always feel worth the effort. [Feb/Mar 2014, p.70]
Andorra	Caribou	Indie	2007-08-21 00:00:00	Filter	83.0	We still have a band trying to blow your mind with pure musicianship and experimentation, while having the balls to show restraint and even unabashed posie-sniffing beauty.
The Believer	Rhett Miller	Rock	2006-02-28 00:00:00	Village Voice (Consumer Guide)	64.0	He thinks he belongs up there in front of that expert new band, singing or shouting whatever banality, profundity, or turn of phrase he's written down, and his level of enthusiasm combined with his level of craft will convince anyone who still likes, you know, songs.
Big Wheel and Others	Cass McCombs	Pop/Rock	2013-10-15 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	75.0	Gentle outlaw Cass McCombs luxuriates in sunlit California landscapes, weaving offbeat tales of carousing and yearning on Big Wheel and Others.
The Marble Downs	"Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy"	Folk	2012-04-09 00:00:00	Uncut	79.0	It has its Mr. Fox-y moments but this feels like a minor clanger. [May 2012, p.83]
I Know You're Married But I've Got Feelings Too	Martha Wainwright	Rock	2008-06-10 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	77.0	The topics are all too familiar, not to mention heavy--a weightiness that doesn't quite match (or do justice to) her light, melodic warble. [13 June 2008]
Holy	Love As Laughter	Indie	2008-06-24 00:00:00	AllMusic	73.0	Jayne and company do manage to pull off a few tracks that capture the old fire and brimstone of classic LAL, but the shiny textures and generic songwriting are too much to overcome, rendering Holy a disappointing addition to the band's previously strong catalog.
R.E.D.	Ne-Yo	Pop	2012-11-06 00:00:00	ElliotZhang	68.0	"I'm a big Ne-Yo fan but this actually is not my favorite Ne-Yo album.

Pushing The Senses	Feeder	Rock	2005-01-31 00:00:00	Dot Music	52.0	Feeder are in danger of being a schizophrenic band, unrecognisable from their once “trademark” sound and prone to style swings on a whim.
Monkeytown	Modeselektor	Electronic	2011-10-11 00:00:00	Spin	67.0	Modeselektor sprinkle the Flying Lotus–style funk sparingly, melting their Teutonic cool just enough to reveal a previously missing musical link: soulfulness.

3D	TLC	Pop	2002-11-12 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	71.0	But in spite of a slim body of songs and an occasionally half-finished feel, the group stakes a solid claim to the riches of future-soul with 3D, leaving a distinct stamp on even its weakest material with gorgeous singing built around the understated grace of '60s girl groups.
Sounds from Nowheresville	The Ting Tings	Pop/Rock	2012-03-13 00:00:00	No Ripcord	52.0	What's also noticeable is how unnecessarily restrained most of the album is.
Hotel California	Tyga	Rap	2013-04-09 00:00:00	PopMatters	50.0	On the one hand, the album does very little of what Tyga’s best at and even when it does, Hotel California makes the strange move of bowing to Tyga’s biting prowess rather than original, ratchet works. On the other, everything here is done perfectly well and enjoyably; unless you’re focused on Tyga’s bars, taking him purely as a presence on some nice beats is not excruciating.
Mr. Beast	Mogwai	Indie	2006-03-07 00:00:00	Playlouder	74.0	Ten years after they first assaulted us, Mogwai remain as vital as ever.
Fall Be Kind [EP]	Animal Collective	Rock	2009-12-15 00:00:00	Alternative Press	84.0	Far from the emperor with no summertime clothes, the five songs on Fall Be Kind--a mixture of holdovers from the MPP sessions and new material recorded this year--retain the electronics, but add some samples and head in a darker thematic direction.
Eyehategod	Eyehategod	Pop/Rock	2014-05-27 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	77.0	Offering plenty of catharsis, Eyehategod gives good acrimony.
Viva La Vida	Coldplay	Rock	2008-06-17 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	72.0	The sonic deviations may challenge fans who prefer that all of the band’s releases be a shade of “Yellow.” But more daring listeners will be relieved that Martin & Co. are exploring new territory.

OnMyRadio	Musiq Soulchild	R&B;	2008-12-09 00:00:00	Boston Globe	75.0	With his fifth album, he pretty much follows his Philly soul formula (even though he now lives in Atlanta), gliding his lithe vocals over keys and an acoustic instrumental dynamic that allow him to shine.
Double Up	R. Kelly	R&B;	2007-05-29 00:00:00	Hot Press	63.0	This is a maddeningly inconsistent collection, with more misses than hits – though Kelly’s best moments do go some way towards atoning for his flaws.
King For A Day	Bobby Conn	Indie	2007-02-20 00:00:00	No Ripcord	70.0	As a whole, it leaves you thinking that Bobby Conn could have, if he wanted to, made a seminal underground record.
Subtitulo	Josh Rouse	Indie	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	68.0	Subtitulo seems slight at first listen, but the songs eventually marry, suggesting the progression from a dead end to a new start. [Apr/May 2006, p.103]
Ultravisitor	Squarepusher	Electronic	2004-03-09 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	74.0	The middle of the album is as hard-edged and relentless as anything of Squarepusher's, if not more.
Be	Common	Rap	2005-05-24 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	83.0	West is the producer Common has been waiting for all of his career: He makes Common both catchier and edgier at the same time.
Ceremonials	Florence + the Machine	Pop/Rock	2011-11-01 00:00:00	Clash Music	75.0	The only real criticism of Ceremonials is that this album is completely, relentlessly, Florence. Her fans will lap it up, while those who aren't keen on her will probably remain unconvinced.
Haughty Melodic	Mike Doughty	Rock	2005-05-03 00:00:00	AllMusic	71.0	The big differences are that guitars are much more prominent than on any Soul Coughing releases, the lyrics have a more personal perspective, and the additional sounds of the album come from warmer sources like piano, Fender Rhodes and horns rather than a sampler.
Nights in the Dark	California X	Pop/Rock	2015-01-13 00:00:00	The 405	69.0	There's no doubting their technical ability, but it counts for little this time around; the hooks that seemed to be the cornerstone of their songwriting last time out are missing in action on this occasion.
Now We Can See	The Thermals	Rock	2009-04-07 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	79.0	Musically, the Thermals deliver a cleaner, more refined version of the raging anthems found on Body, the band's worship of '90s indie rock ringing through louder and clearer than ever before.
Quarantine The Past	Pavement	Rock	2010-03-09 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	85.0	Mixing deathless classics (“Here,” “Gold Soundz,” “Range Life,”) with a few non-album gems (“Frontwards”), it’s a near-ideal primer on the savviest slacker-rock band ever.

I own every album of theirs to date and I can say this is the one I was least excited about. Even their collection of B-sides was better than this. The overall quality has gone down, from the melodies to the lyrics to Chris Collingwood's voice (which has deteriorated into an almost annoying nasal whine.) Only one of the songs was immediately catchy (""The Summer Place"")--which is a rare thing for a FoW album. That said, the album does get better at a very quick rate on repeated listens. And even though I feel it's their worst album, I still think it's decent on the whole and better than a lot of the other stuff out there.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"
Heaven Is Whenever	The Hold Steady	Rock	2010-05-04 00:00:00	Boston Globe	76.0	"With ""Heaven Is Whenever,'' it seems unlikely that the Hold Steady will again change how we talk about modern rock, but when a band has already framed the parameters of the debate, it doesn't necessarily have to."
Great Escape	The Rifles	Indie	2009-01-26 00:00:00	Q Magazine	61.0	Their sound has broadened, too, moving from callow mod-punk towards the big choruses of Kaiser Chiefs. [Nov 2008, p.120]
Panic Prevention	Jamie T	Rap	2007-08-28 00:00:00	Dot Music	71.0	For all the one-paced nature of its songwriting, wilfully lo-fi production values, inevitable Lily Allen comparisons and grating larynx, Panic Prevention is still an enthralling debut, and one that says infinitely more about the life of young Londoners than any amount of Bloc Party seriousness.
Far	Regina Spektor	Rock	2009-06-23 00:00:00	Paste Magazine	74.0	No less than four producers--Mike Elizondo, David Kahne, Jeff Lynne and Garret “Jacknife” Lee--contributed to the album, and their collective efforts have resulted in a mid-tempo muddle of pseudo-lovely tracks plagued by a hovering cloud of meddling strings, slappy drums and perfunctory triangle chimes.
Bushcraft	Baptists	Pop/Rock	2013-02-18 00:00:00	Sputnikmusic	80.0	While not entirely original or deserving of any genre superlatives, Baptists' debut LP is still a welcome addition to the recent crust revival by Southern Lord Records.
Spokes	Plaid	Electronic	2003-11-04 00:00:00	Playlouder	72.0	There is, undoubtedly, something impressive in the craft and detail of Plaid&#146;s labours, but the whole lacks an intangible something to lodge their 'Spokes' securely in our hearts.
The Mind of Traxman	Traxman	Electronic	2012-04-17 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	79.0	"It is tugs and pulls like these [going from raw, minimal stutter to a serenade of a ""foreign-language female vocalist""], that take you to the edge and then let you down quickly but softly, that showcase the heart of what is most appealing about footwork and the genius of Mind of Traxman."
Civilized	stellastarr*	Indie	2009-07-07 00:00:00	PopMatters	56.0	Undeterred by fashion and musical movements having moved on, Stellastarr* have created a joyously out-of-step album. And it deserves to be heard.
Total	SebastiAn	Electronic	2011-07-05 00:00:00	Mojo	66.0	It's difficult to ignore Total's hoovering synths, filtered drums, glam rock rhythms and punkish snarl, such is its fizzing energy. [Jul 2011, p.115]
Personal Life	The Thermals	Pop/Rock	2010-09-07 00:00:00	Billboard.com	72.0	The Thermals may not change your life, as Harris promises on the opener, but they keep on issuing front-to-back fun albums like few other bands.
The  New Classic	Iggy Azalea	Rap	2014-04-22 00:00:00	RapReviews.com	56.0	There's simply not enough substance and individuality for me to call this a good rap album. But at the intersection of rap and pop it doesn't embarrass either side.

Confessions On A Dance Floor	Madonna	Dance	2005-11-15 00:00:00	Uncut	80.0	Such a heady, high-octane swirl that, perversely enough, you often forget you're listening to a Madonna record. [Dec 2005, p.102]
Little Red	Katy B	Electronic	2014-02-03 00:00:00	The Telegraph (UK)	74.0	Assured and still in thrall to the spinning lights, Little Red confidently and unpretentiously reflects Katy B’s transition from eager young clubber with a curfew to a mature young woman with a home of her own and the ability to hold a little something in reserve.
Out Of Breach (Manchester's Revenge)	Mu	Electronic	2005-02-08 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	76.0	Fulton’s beat-making is stellar, but devoting attention to it also necessitates suffering the consistently insufferable Kanamori, and stylistic schizophrenia that’s as jarring as it is unique.
Thank You, Happy Birthday	Cage the Elephant	Pop/Rock	2011-01-11 00:00:00	Q Magazine	76.0	Matt Shultz makes a natural showman firmly in the mouth Perry Farrell mould. Front of house taken care of, it's then just a matter of pairing the noise and excitement, something they achieve in short, sharp bursts with room to spare. [Apr 2011, p.98]
Infiniheart	Chad VanGaalen	Indie	2005-08-23 00:00:00	T-WiLL	80.0	"The single ""Clinically Dead"" will linger in your mind for years. The rest of teh album is a grower. If given the time, a rewarding listen."
Ringleader Of The Tormentors	Morrissey	Rock	2006-04-04 00:00:00	Mojo	75.0	As with everything Morrissey does, ROTT's resonance will elude those not hitherto fascinated by its master's voice. A shame, for in terms of pure musicality, ROTT is possibly his most ecumenical solo album, his most welcoming and loveable. [Apr 2006, p.89]

Boys	Crocodiles	Pop/Rock	2015-05-12 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	65.0	Their shot at “salsa-punk” on new album Boys, though, misses the mark when it comes to differentiating them from the garage boilerplate.
Hissing Fauna, Are You The Destroyer?	Of Montreal	Indie	2007-01-23 00:00:00	Spin	80.0	Hissing Fauna might be an album of ego trips, but at least Barnes is on the good stuff. [Feb 2007, p.85]
These Four Walls	We Were Promised Jetpacks	Indie	2009-07-07 00:00:00	Pitchfork	72.0	They don't have the lyrical complexity of the bands that they will be compared to (from a young U2 to the aforementioned Frightened Rabbit), but they do have the energy and that's a promising place to start.
The Secret Sisters	Secret Sisters	Country	2010-10-12 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	79.0	"Pouring out harmonies on originals (""Tennessee Me""), spunky covers (the kitsch classic ""Something Stupid"") and sublime traditional ballads (""Do You Love an Apple""), they make you believe, for three minutes or so, the lie that music was purer and better way back when."
Shine On	Jet	Rock	2006-10-03 00:00:00	Dot Music	62.0	When you don't have the fun of playing spot-the-steal, all you're left with are wishy washy pastiches and a sense of growing fatigue.
The Flying Club Cup	Beirut	Rock	2007-10-09 00:00:00	BBC collective	80.0	The new album conjures something of Condon’s own imagination, more deftly-etched romantic fiction than dry travelogue, and is all the better for it.
Pearl Jam	Pearl Jam	Rock	2006-05-02 00:00:00	Q Magazine	74.0	[It] is a lusher and less challenging listen than recent efforts, but it's also curiously featureless, the sound of a group drained of passion and fresh ideas. [Jun 2006, p.118]
One Man's Treasure	Mick Harvey	Rock	2005-10-18 00:00:00	AllMusic	71.0	With this outing, Harvey establishes himself not only as a fine composer, but as a songwriter.
Outside	Tapes 'n Tapes	Pop/Rock	2011-01-11 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	66.0	All in all, Outside is a solid third album and a return to form of sorts from a band clearly in the midst of a big transition.
PartyNextDoor Two	PartyNextDoor	Rap	2014-07-29 00:00:00	Pitchfork	46.0	PARTYNEXTDOOR TWO succeeds, much like its predecessor, largely thanks to Brathwaite's aptitude for mood.
The Past Presents The Future	Her Space Holiday	Indie	2005-09-27 00:00:00	joes	60.0	meh
Vs. Children	Casiotone For The Painfully Alone	Indie	2009-04-07 00:00:00	cokemachineglow	79.0	It’s the Casiotone defence mechanism: take your innermost awkward lumps and bathe them in rose-tinted easy listening. Ashworth successfully translate this to his new instruments no fewer than nine or ten times on this eleven track set.
In the Wild	FaltyDL	Electronic	2014-08-12 00:00:00	Fact Magazine (UK)	68.0	There are moments of sheer beauty and reckless fun all over this record, but there’s a looming question mark over whether or not listeners will feel motivated to pick their way through the expanse to enjoy them.
If The Ocean Gets Rough	Willy Mason	Indie	2007-03-20 00:00:00	Uncut	66.0	Weathered and intelligent, these songs resonate like folk antiquities from another age. Even more remarkably, they never sound forced. [Apr 2007, p.116]
My Dinosaur Life	Motion City Soundtrack	Rock	2010-01-19 00:00:00	Alternative Press	79.0	Motion City Soundtrack have made the best album of their career and easily one of the best albums of 2010 or any other year. [Feb 2010, p.91]
The Flaming Lips and Heady Fwends	The Flaming Lips	Pop/Rock	2012-06-26 00:00:00	DIY Magazine	72.0	[The album is] a reminder of musically, just what a great band the Flips themselves actually are.

Everyone song is incredible, atmospheric, dense, accessible, and beautiful.  For those who criticize lines like ""Quench me like Gatorade"" would usually be an adjudicating decision, but it somehow works and sounds fresh coming from David Longstrenth.  The guitar parts on ""Temecula Sunrise"" and ""Two Doves"" really sends it over the edge plus the fantastically organized yet slanted obscurities that are the vocal harmonies.  What a talented group of musicians.  can't wait for the next installment!!&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"
Yes, Virginia...	Dresden Dolls	Indie	2006-04-18 00:00:00	ShakingThrough.net	74.0	If it ultimately feels as if it's slightly less than its predecessor, that's because there's a sense of the band's acting out more in order to try and show how outrageous it can be.
Shape Shifter	Santana	Pop/Rock	2012-05-15 00:00:00	AllMusic	45.0	Its lack of more compelling compositional ideas and some of its ham-fisted production problems are balanced by the fact that Santana is not coasting on his rep any longer; he's trying, and he's playing the hell out of the guitar again.
White Men Are Black Men Too	Young Fathers	Rap	2015-04-07 00:00:00	Uncut	83.0	What most impresses is its warmth, dynamism and unforced difference. [Jun 2015, p.84]
Roots & Echoes	The Coral	Indie	2007-08-06 00:00:00	Hot Press	70.0	Melody takes precedence on Roots And Echoes, and this makes it stronger and tighter than The Coral’s previous releases.
Kings & Queens	The National Trust	Indie	2006-01-24 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	60.0	A majority of the tracks lack in everything but production value.
Yankee Hotel Foxtrot	Wilco	Rock	2002-04-23 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	87.0	''Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'' is a subliminal album. Spin it once and it barely registers. Play it five or six times and its vaporous, insinuating, rusty-carousel melodies start to carve out a permanent orbit in your skull.
Yeah Ghost	Zero 7	Pop	2009-09-29 00:00:00	mtofer	59.0	Yeah Ghost is the result of a musical evolution which nowadays not every ear is ready to revel.

Dungeon Golds	The Minus 5	Pop/Rock	2015-03-10 00:00:00	American Songwriter	76.0	These songs are as trippy, wonderfully produced and well-written as anything in his catalog.
Graduation	Kanye West	Rap	2007-09-11 00:00:00	Los Angeles Times	79.0	The bliss that does surface on Graduation is all in the grooves, which range further than West has ever gone before.
Tarot Sport	Fuck Buttons	Rock	2009-10-20 00:00:00	KendoJ	84.0	Raw, unrefined, genius. Absolutely brilliant.
Born and Raised	John Mayer	Pop/Rock	2012-05-22 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	73.0	The Laurel Canyon music scene of the '60s and '70s is a major touchstone here... and that ramble-tamble style suits him.
Collapse into Now	R.E.M.	Pop/Rock	2011-03-08 00:00:00	Filter	71.0	Despite some small stutter steps, Collapse Into Now is easily the best R.E.M. album since the trio lost its way.
Body Talk Pt 1	Robyn	Dance	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	76.0	Proclamations that only the music matters, not the units shifted, are liable to ring a little hollow. Nevertheless, there's a lot to like about Body Talk Pt. 1.
8 Diagrams	Wu-Tang Clan	Rap	2007-12-11 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	73.0	Yeah, that’s 8 Diagrams--a knockabout set rather than a knife to the jugular.
Graffiti on the Train	Stereophonics	Pop/Rock	2013-03-04 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	64.0	The whole album seems content to be half-awake, so much so that even the comparably adventurous tracks sound like they can't be bothered to get off the couch.
Day & Age	The Killers	Rock	2008-11-24 00:00:00	AllMusic	69.0	The nice thing about Day & Age is that not only is Flowers' voice relatively buried, the Killers are unwittingly comfortable with their ludicrous, outsized pop, which turns the album into terrifically trashy pop. Not the serious rock they yearn to be by any means, but these fashionable threads fit them better anyway.
Fly Yellow Moon	Fyfe Dangerfield	Indie	2010-05-25 00:00:00	Under The Radar	63.0	Though Guillemots have never shied from throwing in any musical ingrediatnt they can find, here that tendency makes for an album that, while strong, comes off a little too unfocused. [Winter 2010, p.62]
Girl on Fire	Alicia Keys	R&B;	2012-11-27 00:00:00	BBC Music	69.0	Girl on Fire is a smart album, maintaining the high standards set on The Element of Freedom.
Romantica	Luna	Rock	2002-04-23 00:00:00	Uncut	76.0	Six albums on and Luna have never sounded better. [Jul 2002, p.112]
The Adventures Of Bobby Ray	B.o.B	Rap	2010-04-27 00:00:00	The Guardian	67.0	But all the Chris Martinesque piano lines and calibrated guest appearances--from Weezer's River Cuomo to Janelle Monae--can't obscure an absence of soul throughout. For someone who raps so often about his days as an up-and-comer, there's a distinct lack of passion.
Rapprocher	Class Actress	Pop/Rock	2011-10-18 00:00:00	Spin	69.0	Nothing on this full-length debut is so insidious, though several tracks come close.
Transfiguration Of Vincent	M. Ward	Indie	2003-03-18 00:00:00	Alternative Press	82.0	M. Ward's creations have the fragility of drawings made in the dust that's settled on a china cabinet. [Apr 2003, p.87]
With Strings Live At Town Hall	Eels	Indie	2006-02-21 00:00:00	Pitchfork	75.0	So go ahead and grant the Eels an exemption for going the orchestra tour route; the additional personnel justifies their paychecks by saving this live album from being a rote greatest-hits-with-crowd-noise exercise.
Yellow House	Grizzly Bear	Indie	2006-09-05 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	79.0	A masterful record.
Free So Free	J. Mascis & the Fog	Indie	2002-10-08 00:00:00	Mojo	72.0	What keeps him afloat is his unflagging pursuit of a good tune. [Nov 2002, p.102]

Out of Season	Beth Gibbons & Rustin Man	Indie	2003-10-07 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	83.0	Out Of Season makes Portishead's remarkable innovations sound like so much extra baggage to Gibbons' voice.
Slow Summits	The Pastels	Pop/Rock	2013-05-28 00:00:00	The Guardian	75.0	Their first full-length album in 16 years displays an unexpected new maturity.

The Nature of Things	The Daredevil Christopher Wright	Pop/Rock	2012-06-26 00:00:00	AllMusic	68.0	Never bland, the Daredevil Christopher Wright rise from good to great when they let their freak flag fly and allow their true weird personalities to come out.
Sucker	Charli XCX	Pop/Rock	2014-12-16 00:00:00	Billboard.com	75.0	Perhaps more than any other young hitmaker, Charli has a sound that is distinctively her own, despite the murderers' row of producer-songwriters onboard.
Cover Magazine	Giant Sand	Indie	2002-03-19 00:00:00	KurtS	71.0	I did not like it personally and thought that it was boring.
Mother	Natalie Maines	Country	2013-05-07 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	70.0	However welcome it may be to hear her voice again, it's ultimately her decision to play things so safe that keeps Mother from being a wholly satisfying return.
Pacific Ocean Blue [Reissue]	Dennis Wilson	Rock	2008-06-17 00:00:00	Pitchfork	87.0	It's also a meditation on a complex world, one devoid of the nostalgic innocence preached by the Mike Love-fronted Beach Boys of late, and its remastered, 2xCD Legacy Recordings release- the first CD release of the album since 1991--is astoundingly refreshing.
()	Sigur Rós	Indie	2002-10-29 00:00:00	Playlouder	82.0	Sigur Ros do this better than anyone else right now.
Push and Shove	No Doubt	Pop/Rock	2012-09-25 00:00:00	Boston Globe	61.0	It sounds like every last detail was worked out through numbing compromise.
Wake Up And Smell The Coffee	The Cranberries	Rock	2001-10-23 00:00:00	Blender	62.0	Wake Up... is the set of inspired anthems they needed to deliver in '96. [Oct/Nov 2001, p.103]
Mr. Impossible	Black Dice	Pop/Rock	2012-04-10 00:00:00	Blurt Magazine	62.0	Mr. Impossible [is] a record that shows a band evolving, as it embraces full-on melodicism with a cheeky goofball spirit.
Yours Truly, The Commuter	Jason Lytle	Indie	2009-05-19 00:00:00	Entertainment Weekly	67.0	Yours Truly, The Commuter, Lytle's solo debut, is a sweetly sad collection of fuzzed-out odes to frustration (the bouncy title track) and furry friends.
Smoke	White Williams	Indie	2007-11-06 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	70.0	While his contrived sonic and visual aesthetics do much to explain the thinness of Smoke, they do not justify it.
In Rolling Waves	The Naked and Famous	Pop/Rock	2013-09-17 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	72.0	The potential is clearly there; The Naked And Famous just need to trim away some of the fat.
Sumday	Grandaddy	Indie	2003-06-10 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	78.0	While they still sound pretty much like Neil Young if he'd heard an Aphex Twin record, the anxieties that '...Slump' articulated have been replaced by frontman Jason Lytle's desire to address more simple matters.
They Were Wrong, So We Drowned	Liars	Indie	2004-02-24 00:00:00	Tiny Mix Tapes	64.0	In the same way Radiohead took an impeccable album like OK Computer and stepped into unfamiliar territory with Kid A, Liars have sidestepped the majority of their familiar styles and broken free towards new explorations.

Into the Lair of the Sun God	Dawnbringer	Pop/Rock	2012-05-29 00:00:00	Pitchfork	82.0	Sun God is an unapologetic, all-or-nothing proposal.
My Garden State	Glenn Jones	Jazz	2013-05-14 00:00:00	Pitchfork	77.0	Aspiring guitarists might need the alternate tuning suggestions, but listeners won’t really need the anecdotes. Rather, Jones puts it all right there in the pieces, speaking volume about the challenges and triumphs of growing up and older without singing a word of the blues.
Frank Black Francis	Frank Black	Indie	2004-10-12 00:00:00	MoneyB	69.0	Great Album! I don&#039;t get the low ratings. A must buy for true pixies fans. Only song that was not so great - planet of sound on disc 2.
The Low Highway	Steve Earle & the Dukes (& Duchesses)	Country	2013-04-16 00:00:00	Austin Chronicle	78.0	Road records have been done so often they've become cliche. Leave it to Earle to stand that notion on its head by revealing the gravel in his veins.
New Amerykah: Part One (4th World War)	Erykah Badu	R&B;	2008-02-26 00:00:00	PopMatters	83.0	While the LP is smart and funky as hell, it distinguishes itself because it's part of a series.
Man On The Moon: The End Of Day	Kid Cudi	Rap	2009-09-15 00:00:00	PopMatters	71.0	Kid Cudi’s take on hip-hop hedonism has as its purpose the escape from one’s own fears and neuroses. He escapes the creatures that haunt him at night by turning himself into a larger-than-life entity: the man on the stage, the man on the moon.
Black Rat	DZ Deathrays	Pop/Rock	2014-08-18 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	77.0	The hangover may be setting in, but DZ Deathrays have found new ways to party.
Aerial	Kate Bush	Rock	2005-11-08 00:00:00	Under The Radar	81.0	At times Aerial feels like such a grandiloquent monument to sweetness and motherhood and baroque English chamber pop that it gets a bit queasy. [#12, p.94]
The Drift	Scott Walker	Rock	2006-05-23 00:00:00	Billboard	85.0	[An] uneasy listening masterwork.
Space Zone	Young Smoke	Electronic	2012-10-02 00:00:00	Fact Magazine (UK)	75.0	Space Zone keeps the bar propped up impressively high without treading back over old ground.
Tricolore	Haiku Salut	Pop/Rock	2013-04-16 00:00:00	Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM)	79.0	Tricolore is enjoyable, but it’s a sum of two different parts; together it comes off as strangely disjointed, like shifting from speaking German to speaking Japanese.
The  End of Silence	Matthew Herbert	Electronic	2013-06-24 00:00:00	The Wire	72.0	The first part of this milary-concrete triptych is mostly vague interference and Radiophonic Workshop-style wibbling about that towards the end, has developed into discomforting BBC Ceefax music. The middle section is sonically richer... Part three is illbient comedown. [Jun 2013, p.51]
Leave Your Sleep	Natalie Merchant	Rock	2010-04-13 00:00:00	PopMatters	75.0	This labor of love (so exhaustively researched, so musically collaborative, so many years in the making) is not elitist or pedantic. It’s just beautiful and special.
Different Gear, Still Speeding	Beady Eye	Pop/Rock	2011-03-01 00:00:00	Consequence of Sound	65.0	So, sure, Beady Eye's first effort is worth a listen. It's not a throw away by any means, and has its keepers, but it does come with its share of faults.
Ring	Glasser	Pop/Rock	2010-09-28 00:00:00	Spin	78.0	It's also in those nature-obsessed lyrics, delivered in tones so dulcet and hypnotic that the inclination to don a robe and commune with Vespertine-era Bjork is overwhelming.
The Difference Between Me And You Is That I'm Not On Fire	McLusky	Indie	2004-05-18 00:00:00	CraigL	78.0	Album of the year. Nobody can match the rockingness, catchiness, or mega hilariousness of McLusky. The greatest band alive.

Era Extrana	Neon Indian	Pop/Rock	2011-09-13 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	76.0	"The band's second disc improves on the ""chillwave"" (read: low-fi synth pop) of its 2009 debut, dunking dreamy early-MTV haircutband balladry in layers of psychedelic schmutz, almost hiding excellent songs in the murk."

Tens are life changing albums, innovative albums, powerful albums, simply enjoyable and awesomeDon't get it twisted, this album is not a ten. Tens are life changing albums, innovative albums, powerful albums, simply enjoyable and awesome albums. This album is not any one of those. And yes, I understand it tells a story, wow that's great. But that only works if the songs are good. But Dj Mustards production is  so slammin, poppin, banging, etc.,ect. But after a while, it is repetitive and to samey samey to provide any lasting impressions. At its best, this album is the good riding music, you're not really paying attention, but the beats knock if you don't listen attentively to them. The rapping, was lackluster. YG didn't grab my attention, over these kind've beats, you need to sound good. If you don't have the lyrical ability to keep me interested at least make it enjoyable to listen to. I understand that this is made for the streets, and in that case, it succeeds because it has lots of bass, and raps that talk about real, honest street stuff, real gangsta **** But overall, it was just hard for me to get through. I didn't really love any of the songs, none that I wanted to return to. And this is coming from a person who listens to a loooot of music, including all of the gangsta rap classics that this album is inspired by. This album just isn't as amazing as everyone says it is. Dat Jay Rock verse was dope though, now that's a gangsta album we need.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Apocalypse Soon [EP]	Major Lazer	Electronic	2014-03-04 00:00:00	The Line of Best Fit	68.0	Skip track one though, leave it to simmer a while, and Apocalypse Soon should inevitably be soundtracking at least some of the summer of 2014.
De-Loused In The Comatorium	The Mars Volta	Rock	2003-06-24 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	82.0	Taken as a piece, the record's free-flowing synthesis of Santana, Yes, and Metallica is overwhelming in a good way.
Whiskey Tango Ghosts	Tanya Donelly	Indie	2004-07-27 00:00:00	Mojo	72.0	Electric piano and pedal steel-caressed intimacy rules the day, keeping attendant preciousness almost, if not completely, at bay. [Aug 2004, p.99]
Trans-Continental Hustle	Gogol Bordello	Rock	2010-04-27 00:00:00	Pitchfork	72.0	"Results are mixed--""Sun Is on My Side"" offers lovely accordion and a weary, haunting refrain, but the midtempo ""Uma Menina Uma Cigana"" feels flat and perfunctory, while the lugubriousness of ""When Universes Collide"" actually undermines Hutz's harrowing, poverty-tinged lyrics."
Pawn Shoppe Heart	The Von Bondies	Indie	2004-03-09 00:00:00	Mojo	80.0	They have an inherent gift for the split-second pause, the cool coda, the scene-stealing lyric. [Feb 2004, p.98]

World Wide Rebel Songs	Tom Morello	Pop/Rock	2011-08-29 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	61.0	His voice here, a husky and burly drawl not too far removed from Johnny Cash's, is a constant delight throughout and is seemingly tailor-made for launching his volleys of criticism and cries for activism.
Black & Blue	Backstreet Boys	Pop	2000-11-21 00:00:00	Q Magazine	61.0	The sound has changed little, and the level of emoting none.

I Bet on Sky	Dinosaur Jr.	Alternative/Indie Rock	2012-09-18 00:00:00	Mojo	75.0	Though lacking the infernal dynamics of 2009's Farm, there remains sufficient compensation to delight Dino devotees. [Oct 2012, p.88]
The  Terror	The Flaming Lips	Pop/Rock	2013-04-16 00:00:00	Spin	77.0	By facing down the exhausting nature of depression and loneliness (seriously, Coyne sounds so depleted that he can barely muster the dejection to sing, and yes, that's a compliment), the Lips have retroactively strengthened their entire artistic credo.

Failed States	Propagandhi	Alternative/Indie Rock	2012-09-04 00:00:00	AllMusic	79.0	The band gives the songs greater depth rather than always putting the message right there on the surface, and this change allows the listener to dive into the songs to really absorb and understand them.
Home Life	Andrew Cedermark	Pop/Rock	2013-07-16 00:00:00	Pitchfork	79.0	While Cedermark is an ace guitarist and affecting lyricist, his songwriting isn’t quite as rigorous or sharp.

Construction Sounds	Schneider TM	Pop/Rock	2012-10-09 00:00:00	The Wire	76.0	There's a feeling of disconnect between idea and result, with Construction Sounds tending towards solid but unremarkable investigation of texture. [Nov 2012, p.72]

The Old Kit Bag	Richard Thompson	Rock	2003-05-06 00:00:00	Amazon.com	81.0	Fortunately, this spare approach serves Thompson well because he's such a strong and varied songwriter plus a remarkably distinctive guitarist.

Club	67.0	The Girl In The Other Room represents an experiment for Krall, and not an entirely successful one, but at the end of the record, having demonstrated the confidence to explain herself, she comes out with some of her most persuasive music yet.
Hard Boiled Soft Boiled	Odonis Odonis	Pop/Rock	2014-04-15 00:00:00	NOW Magazine	77.0	The band’s second album has terrific production values, and beneath all the industrial edges and gothic stomp, Dean Tzenos’s vocals are surprisingly melodic.

Last Train to Paris	Diddy	Pop	2010-12-14 00:00:00	New Musical Express (NME)	75.0	The chilly Euro-house stylings may be a mite predictable but Diddy  proves a generous curator, laying on blockbuster exhibits and atmospheric slow jamz alike in the greatest cast-of-millions hip-hop joint since, well, Kanye's latest.

The Pursuit	Jamie Cullum	Pop	2010-03-02 00:00:00	AllMusic	72.0	Much of The Pursuit mines this fertilely mellow vein, producing a bunch of understatedly melodic music whose consistency only suggests that Cullum should stop dabbling with detours and just accept his strength as a soft rock singer/songwriter.
Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon	Devendra Banhart	Rock	2007-09-25 00:00:00	Q Magazine	69.0	Intriguing though Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon is, it remains unclear how he and his peculiar talent will thrive out there. [Oct 2007, p.104]

Too Bright	Perfume Genius	Pop/Rock	2014-09-23 00:00:00	Pitchfork	87.0	"These songs feel less like songs and more like treasures, ones that fill you with power and wisdom, and as a result, Too Bright seems capable of resonating with, comforting, and moving anyone who's ever felt alienated, discriminated against, or ""other-ized,"" regardless of sexual orientation."
Dangerous Dreams	Moving Units	Indie	2004-10-12 00:00:00	AllMusic	53.0	A case of too little, too late, nothing on Moving Units' full-length debut Dangerous Dreams does anything to disprove the feeling that the dance-punk scene is at best overcrowded and at worst approaching rigor mortis any day now.
Who Is the Sender?	Bill Fay	Pop/Rock	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Magnet	76.0	The songs all deal with weighty subjects, but the music, a s pleasing hybrid of blues, rock, classical and gospel impulses shines the comforting light of faith onto every time. [No. 120, p.54]

Title TK	The Breeders	Rock	2002-05-21 00:00:00	BenjaminBunny	71.0	"I would venture to say that ""Off You"" is the most beautiful song of Deal&#039;s career. A laid-back, lonely, lovely record."
Regeneration	The Divine Comedy	Indie	2001-11-06 00:00:00	Dot Music	77.0	Nearly everything that was once infuriating and irritating about The Divine Comedy has now been eradicated in favour of a new honesty and depth to their sound complete with some genuinely touching moments.
The Versailles Sessions	Murcof	Electronic	2008-12-09 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	75.0	Lesser artists might fall prey to pastiche, something Murcof artfully avoids. Instead he pulls off a remarkable feat--he makes the forgotten sound formidable, and the contemporaneous sound credible.
N.O.W. Is the Time	Nightmares on Wax	Electronic	2014-06-17 00:00:00	AllMusic	76.0	All of it fits together surprisingly well here--a satisfying, if imperfect, sampling.

I knew of Ed Sheeran before he got his break but as a fully fledged artist he has delivered a fantastic first album. Lead single ""A-Team"" is one of, if not the best song thus far this year it's a bittersweet, deep meaningful song and even now I still love the sound of it. ""You Need Me, I Don't Need You"" is more upbeat and delivers an edgier sound. + generally is an outstanding album as there is not a bad song on it ""Drunk"", ""U.N.I"", ""Small Bump"" and ""Kiss Me"" all spring to mind but the standout song and one of the best of the year is ""Lego House"" a beautiful song which is lyrically genius and continues to be on replay within the household it's a terrific tune and has a real fun video starring Rupert Grint (aka Ron Weasley to Harry Potter fans).

Watch Me Dance	Toddla T	Electronic	2011-09-13 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	67.0	An escapist Jamaica-pop lark with a traditional bent and a big heart, in the realms of good-times bass you could do a lot worse than the classy and charming Watch Me Dance.

Circular Sounds	Kelley Stoltz	Indie	2008-02-05 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	71.0	While Circular Sounds isn’t quite the modern sound of the American west coast, it feels very much like the classic sound of California: a sound left blissfully alone by the stresses and rigours of a modernity forever on the move.
The Earth Is Blue	Damon & Naomi	Indie	2005-02-22 00:00:00	Rolling Stone	76.0	Kurihara's sweet swells turn into fuzzed-out jams alongside Naomi's fluid bass and wraithlike vocals and Damon's feathery cymbal play and murky poetry.

I could praise it for hours and hours. ""Nobody's Daughter"" states Courtney's faults and shows a vulnerable side to her that nobody has seen while still having the emotional, powerful lyrics that she always has had. It's a very amazing album and it has so much meaning behind it. There is something about Nobody's Daughter that I haven't felt with any other album... It's like Courtney is instead of avoiding her scars and mistakes she is overcoming them and standing up and saying F*** You and I'm back.. I could literally praise this album FOR HOURS.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"
Don't Stop	Annie	Rock	2009-11-17 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	77.0	The inescapable feeling that Don’t Stop probably won’t sell all that many copies makes the songs sound like electric guitars without amplifiers. There are only so many things a musician can provide and sadly Annie has it all but that key component.
A  Fairway Full of Miners	Boats	Pop/Rock	2013-02-05 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	64.0	Whilst Boats appear more polished, the energetic ramshackle anthem of Great Skulls seems keen to remind everyone that it’s not precision, but feeling that is important.

Sing The Sorrow	AFI	Rock	2003-03-11 00:00:00	AllMusic	81.0	"Just when the strings, piano, and rainstorm effects threaten to turn Sing the Sorrow into a My Dying Bride album, there is a burst of hardcore like ""Dancing Through Sunday"" to recall California pioneers of the genre like Dead Kennedys or SST transplants Husker Du."
Era Vulgaris	Queens of the Stone Age	Rock	2007-06-12 00:00:00	Stylus Magazine	75.0	Era Vulgaris gets better with each listen, and that’s mostly due to the fact that the melodies take time to sink in.
Cancer4Cure	El-P	Rap	2012-05-22 00:00:00	Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM)	84.0	This is a high point in his already illustrious career; a labyrinthine and ultramodern take on hip-hop that will likely age like a Cabernet.
Confessions On A Dance Floor	Madonna	Dance	2005-11-15 00:00:00	The New York Times	80.0	But she's not attempting a simple 80's revival; for all the vaguely familiar hooks, there are also sustained, wistful overlays of strings and acoustic guitar that enfold the music like a haze of indistinct memory.

Drown Out	Daedelus	Electronic	2013-09-17 00:00:00	Q Magazine	66.0	This latest studio offering is equally tricky to categorise. The mood, though, never overwhelms. [Dec 2013, p.105]
A Day Without Rain	Enya	Pop	2000-11-21 00:00:00	JonL	41.0	This album is a musical Quaalude, which isn&#039;t necessarily a bad thing, but its sheer vapidity is enough to infuriate me.

Hardly the british equivalent of truly dull bands such as the Creed (no matter what anyone says, since the Stereophonics can actually write.!). and although they&#039;ve never been truly dull, some of their work hasnt always inspired.. This album is different. Although not exactly a Marilyn Manson style shout-fest (although edgier tracks such as Deadhead come close) this LP is easily the hardest and most interesting they&#039;ve ever released. If youve never liked the Stereophonics and/or have lent towards much more rockier material, give this album a go- you might just be surprised.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
II	Moderat	Electronic	2013-08-06 00:00:00	Resident Advisor	74.0	Where Moderat sounded at times tentative and disjointed, II is in every regard a better and more well-rounded record. If there were no third Moderat album, this would stand as a definitive statement.

Face Tat	Zach Hill	Pop/Rock	2010-10-19 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	74.0	At times, the album may seem like it's made to confuse as much as thrill, but neither of those gets to the truth of Face Tat. Simply put, to paraphrase one of Hill's lyrics, it'll turn you into energy.

You get the feeling that this is a person that has been through allot but somehow she made. Thus, Like a Rose hits on a human level that you forget how talented she is. Like a Rose feels like a one on one conversation.On the Blade you find a confident Ashley Monroe that knows how good she is and how good she can be and she holds no punches. Thus, The Blade feel like a talent show and a very good one. The production is bold and the vocal performances are bold. At time, its hard to find something to hold on too for a long period of time and the album can feel overwhelming. Which is strange because, unlike Like a Rose, like album is more of a concept album about break-up and relationships (the two sides of relationship).She could have bundled the heartbreak songs and separated those from the lighter songs but obviously I am just fishing for something to complain about as one has to in a review. Bottom line, Monroe is a great songwriter and a great singer and the Blade is a showcase of that. There are some songs on this album that will stay with you for a very long time, the title track, I'm Good at Leavin', and ""If the Devil Don't Want Me"" are my favorite songs.I wish Monroe would make a non-country album but no pop or pop-rock; maybe a blue rock or a bluegrass album just to see if she can do it, but the fans always wish for things like these and then complain. Just will be just fine with country. 85/100&hellip;Full Review &raquo;"
Outbursts	Turin Brakes	Rock	2010-03-30 00:00:00	Pitchfork	66.0	"Nothing on Outbursts turns out to overblown sonically, but ""Sea Change"" does signal a straining quality that runs throughout the album."
Padded Room	Joe Budden	Rap	2009-02-24 00:00:00	Prefix Magazine	70.0	The Joe Budden on Padded Room, however, is focused and hungry, spinning dense, psychological yarns that build for dozens and dozens of bars. Budden scratched and clawed for his second chance, and he hasn’t squandered it.
Everybody Down	Kate Tempest	Rap	2014-05-20 00:00:00	RapReviews.com	77.0	Everybody Down may try to tackle too much in its 48-minute run time, but even if the story isn't always coherent, the emotions of the characters shine through.
Brothers	The Black Keys	Rock	2010-05-18 00:00:00	PopMatters	82.0	Much like the Black Keys themselves, this is not an all-time classic for the ages, but it’s very good. Most bands don’t get around to pulling that off, and still fewer do it on their sixth full-length album.
The Fifth	Dizzee Rascal	Rap	2013-09-30 00:00:00	The Guardian	51.0	It isn't art, but it is a hit-packed, goofy album that may prove impossible to dislike.
Wild Hunt	The Tallest Man on Earth	Rock	2010-04-13 00:00:00	Dusted Magazine	79.0	"Much of what made Shallow Grave so striking was its density, its pairing of deftly constructed lyrics with rapid-fire notes and chords. At times, some of the songs on The Wild Hunt--specifically ""You're Going Back"" and ""Love is All""--lead with the more abrasive side of Mattson's voice but don't land with much impact."

Back On My B.S.

Voxtrot	Voxtrot	Indie	2007-05-22 00:00:00	PopMatters	71.0	If Voxtrot seems less magical the first time through, it grows in stature with each listen, as an album should.
All Eternals Deck	The Mountain Goats	Pop/Rock	2011-03-29 00:00:00	Drowned In Sound	77.0	It may not be the old Mountain Goats kick, but whatever it is, it'll keep me returning to All Eternals Deck for a long, long time.
See You Happy	Ponies In The Surf	Indie	2008-06-10 00:00:00	The Boston Phoenix	72.0	It’s brimming with curious melodies (like the darkly cute skews of the title track), rich poetic detail (as lush as the orange carpet in '16A'), and a truly generous spirit (you can listen to the whole damn thing over and over).
This Machine Kills Artists	King Buzzo	Pop/Rock	2014-06-03 00:00:00	The Line of Best Fit	69.0	It is an interesting experiment, but realistically most listeners will struggle to get past the first couple of tracks before reaching for their trusty copy of Houdini.
The Fire Theft	The Fire Theft	Indie	2003-09-23 00:00:00	Alternative Press	63.0	Yes, it sounds like Yes, and, no, I don't mean that in a good way. [Nov 2003, p.99]
XI Versions of Black Noise	Pantha du Prince	Electronic	2011-04-19 00:00:00	The Boston Phoenix	62.0	The pointlessness is grating. XI Versions' final three songs do show signs of life--Animal Collective, Walls, and Pantha himself manage to work up a buzz--but they can't compensate for time killers by Lawrence, Carsten, and Efdemin that make inoffensiveness offensive.
I Dreamed We Fell Apart	Memphis	Indie	2004-09-21 00:00:00	Launch.com	67.0	The basic ingredients are delicate, minimal, well-conceived songs that utilize instruments ranging from guitars and analog keyboards to melodicas and chop sticks.
Beat Pyramid	These New Puritans	Rock	2008-03-18 00:00:00	Q Magazine	76.0	Anyone bored by the kitchen sink will find much to love here. [Feb 2008, p.97]
Freedom's Road	John Mellencamp	Rock	2007-01-23 00:00:00	Blender	65.0	"There are two vastly different Mellencamps. One is a flag-waver, singing simplistic anthems like ""Our Country."" The other, overshadowed Mellencamp is quieter and wiser. [Mar 2007, p.136]"
Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World	Original Soundtrack	Rock	2010-08-10 00:00:00	ImmersedInSound	68.0	The movie is incredible. Everything about it is awesome and this soundtrack is one of them.A mash up of genres, decades and tones containingThe movie is incredible. Everything about it is awesome and this soundtrack is one of them.A mash up of genres, decades and tones containing artists such as Sex Bob-Omb, Beachwood Sparks, Beck and The Rolling Stones, this soundtrack is great fun to listen to. Maybe if you haven't seen the movie it might all seem a bit random, so being a fan could help, but as long as you appreciate good songs you will probably like it.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Little Neon Limelight	Houndmouth	Country	2015-03-17 00:00:00	AllMusic	74.0	Houndmouth have the right touch and impressive chops, but this album makes it clear they needs a songwriter who can make their music seem fresh even as it's modeled on the past.
Hawk	Isobel Campbell	Pop/Rock	2010-08-24 00:00:00	Pitchfork	75.0	Hawk is very much Campbell's album. She made all the big artistic decisions, her face is front and center on the cover, and Lanegan shows up on only eight of the album's 13 tracks.
Single Mothers	Justin Townes Earle	Country	2014-09-09 00:00:00	The A.V. Club	73.0	Earle’s consistency is both his friend and his enemy on Single Mothers. In its quest for poignant empathy and delicate strokes of storytelling, it doesn’t vary much in tone.
Lost Horizons	Lemon Jelly	Electronic	2002-10-08 00:00:00	Uncut	81.0	Think early Air meets hip-hop, the West Coast harmonies and Ultramarine-style tech-fok eccentricities merging with euphoric yet becalmed moodscapes. [Nov 2002, p.113]
Dry Land is Not a Myth	White Arrows	Pop/Rock	2012-06-19 00:00:00	AllMusic	70.0	A certain kind of playfulness reigns throughout much of the album.
Pain Killer	Little Big Town	Country	2014-10-21 00:00:00	joyel1992	83.0	One of the best country album Ive heard in a while.. lately i was very impressed with the song Smoking n Drinking in Miranda Lambert's albumOne of the best country album Ive heard in a while.. lately i was very impressed with the song Smoking n Drinking in Miranda Lambert's album platinum which caught my ear, had to take a look at this album. It was totally worth it.Standouts - Day Drinking, Tumble & Fall, Pain Killer, Faster Gun, Live Forever&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Swing Lo Magellan	Dirty Projectors	Pop/Rock	2012-07-10 00:00:00	PopMatters	80.0	What really shines through the most on Magellan are the qualities that can be obscured when all the attention is paid to Dirty Projectors' obvious proficiency and omnivorous tastes: their enthusiasm and love for music. No matter how weird and challenging things might get, there's a feeling of joy that's palpable in the songs here.
Maraqopa	Damien Jurado	Pop/Rock	2012-02-20 00:00:00	Beats Per Minute (formerly One Thirty BPM)	81.0	These songs are probably Jurado's most ambitious portraits yet in terms of ideas and eclecticism.
Son	Juana Molina	Indie	2006-06-06 00:00:00	The Wire	79.0	What's distinctive about Son is that it is more layered and inventive than Segundo and Tres Cosas. [#268, p.58]
Holiday	Port St. Willow	Pop/Rock	2013-04-02 00:00:00	musicOMH.com	80.0	At times this recording is compelling, entrancing even with its sheer beauty; occasionally though it drags.
Majenta	Jimmy Edgar	Electronic	2012-12-04 00:00:00	Pitchfork	59.0	"Unfortunately, more than mediocre tracks or throaty sexual goofs, what does in Majenta is its scattershot nature. There's no flow to the way the album's sequenced, to the point where it seems purely arbitrary. Furthermore, Edgar seems so concerned about skipping between genres that he neglects to refine any one specific sound; even the strongest cuts rarely rise above ""nice try."""
Love Is Here	Starsailor	Rock	2002-01-08 00:00:00	Screenager	72.0	A beautifully crafted debut album and one of the best post-Britpop albums available. James Walsh's vocal delivery coupled with the minimalistA beautifully crafted debut album and one of the best post-Britpop albums available. James Walsh's vocal delivery coupled with the minimalist instrumentation creates a truly brilliant record.&hellip;Full Review &raquo;
Days	Real Estate	Pop/Rock	2011-10-18 00:00:00	Blurt Magazine	77.0	A fine batch of bittersweet pop songs that are nearly impossible to ignore.
Rebirth	Lil Wayne	Rap	2010-02-02 00:00:00	No Ripcord	37.0	The derivativeness quickly overwhelms.
Blue Songs	Hercules & Love Affair	Electronic	2011-08-16 00:00:00	PopMatters	68.0	Blue Songs finds Butler and his crew of collaborators laying back to a place where the dance floor can be as much a place for ethereal contemplation as it is for unrepentant debauchery.
England, Half English	Billy Bragg	Rock	2002-03-05 00:00:00	Spin	64.0	England's exoticism is offset by plenty of tough and tender ballads, and even the most stridently worldbeat numbers are joyous, well-made, and never patronizing. [Apr 2002, p.117]
Weezer (Red Album)	Weezer	Rock	2008-06-03 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	64.0	Weezer seems to have driven their old shtick into the ground so perfectly, it almost seems like they've purposely become tired and boring.
Dreams and Nightmares	Meek Mill	Rap	2012-10-30 00:00:00	AllMusic	69.0	As far as graduations from mixtapes to major-label releases go, this one is still satisfying and a step forward, plus slicked up and pimped out in a way that's entirely Maybach.
Outer South	Conor Oberst And The Mystic Valley Band	Indie	2009-05-05 00:00:00	Slant Magazine	67.0	The result is an album that's unfortunately baggy and sodden with filler, which could have benefited from a little less camaraderie and a little more revision.
On An Island	David Gilmour	Rock	2006-03-07 00:00:00	E! Online	67.0	In the end, Island makes Dave sound like he's just not enthusiastic about making music anymore.
Movement	Gossip	Indie	2003-05-06 00:00:00	Uncut	81.0	Beth Ditto's remarkable gospel holler and fervent anti-sexist agenda deserves--no, demands--to be heard by a much bigger audience. [Aug 2003, p.106]
Locked Down	Dr. John	Pop/Rock	2012-04-03 00:00:00	PopMatters	86.0	Dr. John is Dr. John. He's a star, and is on fire at the center of this.
And Their Refinement Of The Decline	Stars Of The Lid	Rock	2007-04-07 00:00:00	PopMatters	87.0	Their work, especially that displayed on Refinement, stands as some of the more original and evocative music being produced today, smart and technical without sacrificing atmosphere and feeling.
