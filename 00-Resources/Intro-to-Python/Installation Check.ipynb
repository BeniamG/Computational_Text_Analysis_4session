One facet of this effort will be a shared repository of knowledge regarding bugs and Python itself. To that end, we ask that each time you get an error message, you create a new thread on the bCourses page for this workshop. We hope to see dialogue around its resolution as well as a record that we can refer back to later. After all, if you see an error message, it's almost certain that someone else will get it too."
